       "[(\"Stayed here for five nights in mid February. The hotel is not central to Maastricht but is convenient for the Exhibition and Conference Centre. The hotel makes up for its location by providing a shuttle service to the town centre and the conference facilities. The shuttle does have a timetable but we found that they will in fact take you anywhere anytime. Return trips from the town centre benefit from a cut price taxi service on production of the Novotel voucher.,The hotel is well appointed and very comfortable. Public areas are spacious and the restaurant facilities are good with a varied and well thought out dinner menu. Food is available in the bar throughout the day. My bedroom was large with  bathroom and toilet in two further rooms. It was clean and pleasantly decorated. A queen size bed and sofa were good points from which to view the forty five channels of TV available in various languages. As is often the case staff make or break a hotel and in this case they could not, withoput exception, be faulted. They achieved exactly the right balance between friendliness and professionalism. Although it was the conference season we got a very good rate by dealing direct withy the hotel.

Check out was equally easy – just drop the room key into the box.  ,The room was small but clean and only basics are provided – one clean towel for each person and body wash cum shampoo.  There is no coffee maker, kettle, fridge or hair dryer.  If you need hot water, you can get them for free from the vending machine near the reception.

They are not the cleanest and when I opened my fridge there was a clump of (what appeared to be, though no proof ) pubic hair. Disgusting!,As we were staying here through work we had a group booking ( 7 men on the night we stayed) after returning from work we were informed by a very rude lady staff member we would not be permitted to eat in the restaurant because if we ate as a group, there may not be enough food for other guests. That meant we had to eat at McDonald's a lot, it is right across the road. ,Another interesting happening, I was working on my computer at around 8pm when a staff member just walked in my room, looked at me and asked if I was ok. After ringing reception to enquire why this had happened, I was told because the room had been cleaned they then had to check it. Still don't understand this . ,The attitude of staff is terrible, you can tell they do not want to be here ( except the guy who checked us in, very good guy.... can't remember his name sorry),Shampoo and soaps not replenished daily. Complimentary water bottles not replenished or empty bottles removed. ,There is NOTHING around this hotel other than mac Donald's. ,No hot breakfast till after 7am.......,GOOD POINTS:,very very good showers ( maybe the best hotel shower I've had) .

First impressions of the room were reasonably favourable despite my \"runway view\" being no more than an outbuilding with a few tail fins showing above it.,I knew the room would be small so that was not an issue. It did feel a bit like having a bed in the bathroom but I kinda expected that.,Thye biggest let down for me was the qiality of the (free) wireless internet. Despite a strong radio signal the routing was so intermittent as to render it useless. Websites, email, everything would time out repeatedly.,After leaving the room to sample the over-priced snack food I was unable to get back in. Help was summoned and my lock effectively needed a \\'reboot\\' before I could get back in.,In the morning I couldn\\'t get the main lights to switch on either through the \\'mood pad\\' or wall control.,The shower needs careful planning if you\\'re not going to receive a blast of cold water to kick-start your day. You can\\'t turn it on with the door open. Despite starting it set to feed only the hand-held head, as soon as you switch to the main showerhead there is an initial flow of unheated water which is hard to avoid.,I was starting to feel trapped in failed-technology hell!,The bed is big but very firm and I didn\\'t find it particularly comfortable, but i guess that\\'s a very personal thing.,As has been commented on several times already, the toilet and shower facilities are completely lacking in privacy.

DesIndes offers all modern amenities but does this in a very classy  way with a touch of the good old times. ,The lobby feels like being at the Titanic, thick carpets, classy lights and - on Sundays- an outstanding high tea!,All the rooms more or less are a little bit different while equal in style.  Junior suites that face the front are calm and spacious. I wouldn\\'t push for a two storied junior suite as I think they are a little dark. For turndown they also add a tray with tea either \"good night white tea\" or \"Anna Pavlova Melange\" named after a ballet dancer that stayed there several times. Lovely and warm hearted!,The food at DesIndes is outstanding, the restaurant really good. The home made icecream is not cheap but outstanding!  You should really try it at least once!  They also produce all different sorts of food themselves, like mustard or jam! Really really delicious!,The pool is really small, with a small steam room and sauna, so if you really look for this there are better options in The Hague, but I always like though since rarely it happened that there was more than one other guest. So it was not too small.,What needs to be mentioned as it makes most of the charm of the hotel is the staff. Imagine you have a hotel full of history and mainly young staff - young staff that knows how to treat you in such a historic house. The head concierge and guest relations manager is Marie Anne. Rarely have I ever found a person in a hotel that so much stands for what the Luxury Collection wants to represent. She arranges whatever you ask for and does so in a very respectful way. My friend always asks for various options before making a choice and Marie Anne managed to understand his way of thinking quickly and offered many options that where exactly what we were looking for. If you are there: trust her!,To sum things up: I stayed there several times and whenever I am in the region this is my fist choice.

It was 4.10 Euros one way. ,I bought IAMSTERDAM CARD for 72 hrs (24 hours: €49 / 48 hours: €59 / 72 hours: €69). The card works two ways. For transportation, once you activate the card e.g. on the tram, it will run till the end of your purchase period.

The hotel was very convenient for this purpose, being only a few minutes walk from the airport.,The hotel is very modern and funky, with a lobby looking like one of the brighter room displays in an Ikea. Check-in is via a number of terminals at the front door and was very straight forward, but staff where on hand to assist if required. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant, but the lobby sells snacks and drinks and general merchandise. I didn't make use of this facility, and just grabbed a coffee and croissant in the airport shops for breakfast. The lobby also has four apple macs in the lobby that provide free internet access along with a couple of tvs spread out through the open plan area.,The rooms are small, but functional for a short stay, which is fine as I imagine the majority of guests are only staying for a night or two. The room is the width of the very large bed, which was very comfortable. The sink is part of the room along with 2 bathroom pods - one for the toilet and one for the shower. A thin curtain can be drawn between the sleeping area and the pods, but this design is not for the shy!  The shower itself has a useful hand held wand along with a rain shower in the ceiling of the pod. Toiletries are provided in dual purpose (shower gel & shampoo), larger style bottles. These are in two different fragrances which are perfectly functional but nothing to get excited about.,The electronics in the room are controlled by a hand held mood pad which is stored in a charger on the wall. It controls the blinds, the tv and lighting. The lighting is available in a range of colours and the pad is a nice novelty item, possibly not as handy as a good old fashioned light switch in the long term but a cool gadget to have a play with on a short stay.,Overall the room was clean and quiet and good value for money, with the room only rate much cheaper than the other nearby hotels.

I arrived at the hotel at 12.45pm and inquired about early check-in – which I understand depends on availability. I had deliberately checked the Marriott website the night before and the hotel wasn’t fully booked but I was told that the hotel was fully booked?? And that “our guests are ALL Platinum so they can have 4pm check out, and I don’t know what rooms are empty”. ,Surely your receptionist would be told that frequent travelers like platinum/titanium members normally check the occupancy the night before to know about availability for early check in, and the likelihood of ALL the guest being on 4pm checkout is incredibly rare. I don’t understand how your reception desk is unaware of what rooms are empty at any particular time. The Reservations Manager should have a system in place to work alongside housekeeping to update the reception on early check outs etc. Airport hotels, especially ones without conference rooms often are used by people who have early flights and being that the hotel has shuttles to the airport every 20min until 10am and then only every 40min after that it would suggest that the hotel has a lot of people on early check out to take the shuttle.,I sat down to wait and just 25 minutes later a room was available but by this point I was already annoyed by the information that I had been given that it had ruined my first experience of the hotel.

Great service from staff and quality of food. Then on the 30th we arrived for breakfast at what seemed like a completely different restaurant.

After they had finished their fight he told me “you will have to wait as I’m very busy.” The Morning restaurant staff seemed very short and abrupt in their answers and lacked friendliness. The great food that is offered is overshadowed by the poor performance from the staff.,We had checked the Hotel shuttle timetable in the reception area the night before and planned breakfast around the 8.20am shuttle so we would be on time for check-in. These timetables are was displayed throughout the hotel including reception. We waited and 8.20 passed without a shuttle so I asked at reception and was told that the shuttle was not coming because the timetable that was displayed was not up to date.,I thought this was strange so I asked why the schedule was not updated and I was told because the Hotel had only been informed on Monday and no one had been able to change the signs. This was now Saturday – I was speechless and angry at how a hotel brand such as Renaissance couldn’t get their act together and print a new timetable in 6 days, and why if the staff already knew that the schedule was not correct they wouldn’t pass this information on to the guests. I asked to speak to manager and was told that she was the duty manager - Miriam. I explained that we would now be late for check in and that this had added a huge amount of stress to our morning. She explained that because it’s a complementary service that she was sorry – but we would have to find our own solution to get to the airport.,I left the hotel very disappointed from my experience. If people ask me my opinion of your hotel it would be to avoid this as part of the Marriott chain.,To add this review was sent to the hotel by Renaissance head office and more than a week later i have still not heard back from the hotel - this perfectly describes how poorly the hotel is managed',\n",

One of the big advantages of this area is that parking is without any charges. Something that is quite unique in the Netherlands. However, if you want to be sure of a parking spot, the hotel is offering it for €12 per night. I opted for this because it was very busy with daytrip tourists during our stay and I did not want to walk a mile to reach the hotel (with our three months old little baby girl).,For years the Atlantic is very popular with Germans, but many guests are also from the Netherlands. Do not expect young hipsters, more likely you will meet the 40-50+ segment and some families with children. The hotel rates do reflect this because you can expect to pay around €100-120 per night excluding breakfast.,The breakfast buffet is reasonably good, but a bit overpriced though at around €19 per person. Therefore please try to find a touroperator deal which has breakfast included. You should be able to get a deal around €90 (or less) per room with them without spending too much searching time in the net.,The standard room we booked was quite okay. It was clean, had a nice bathroom with a bath, hairdryer and the usual NH toilet items (soap bar, shampoo, conditioner). An iron board, fridge and electronic save (although too small to store a laptop, but fine for a tablet) and coffee & tea making facilities are also offered. The Philips TV is a rather old fashioned model, but worked fine for us. Besides, who want to see television while the lovely Kijkduin beach is just steps away? A really nice touch is the balcony that each room has. Always wonderful to spend some time there in the morning or watching sunset. Anyone who is complaining about the rooms is in my opinion only used to stay at the Hilton or Hyatt top range proporties...,Wi-fi is free of charge, but too slow to be hounest. The hotel should really upgrade their connections to attract and keep younger guests. Both in the Business and Leisure segment. By the way all rooms are equiped with plenty power outlets, ideal for recharging all your electronic devices!,If you are looking for a relaxed and comfortable beach stay in the Netherlands, than the NH Atlantic hotel is your place to be.

Firstly the hotel is in the centre of the Hague's 'old town' which is a very pleasant place to spend the evening. It is also in a large but old building and has clearly recently re-opened after total refurbishment. ,The reception has that 'grandeur' associated with two receptionists siting behind a wonderful antique table rather than some impersonal reception area. This helps build strong first impressions.,These are not let down by the rooms which are not oversized but very comfortable with a large and very comfortable bed and a bathroom that has high quality fittings (in general). Very similar style to the (highly recommended) College Hotel in Amsterdam. If you have a thing about high ceilings - be warned they are miles above your head.,My only concern about my room (and it should be yours also) is that it was on the ground floor and right next door to the main entrance of the hotel. I was very surprised that the Meridian ever decided to put any rooms on the ground floor of an 'inner city' Hotel that was so close to 'traffic' both of the vehicular and human variety. I enquired as to whether they thought this room might be rather noisy and was told that on a Saturday it could be a problem but on a Thursday night I should be fine.,Having had a very good dinner at the local italian restaurant (Casa Contini - I think it was called - go down side street by the 'Juliene' (much more formal) restaurant and it is on the left. Great host, fine wine and full of lively dutch all having a good time) - I went back to my hotel room having fully taken on board the heavily increased noise levels from the adjacent street with all its restaurants and bars. My fears of a sleepless night escalated when back in my room three teenagers seemed to camp on their bicycles right outside my window. After half an hour of high pitched laughing I decided a room change was advisable. ,At this point the hotel staff could not have been more helpful and I was duly shown to an available room on the 2nd floor right opposite the 'Juliene' restaurant on 'Party' street. Well ....it was even noisier ... so finally ended up back next to the front door. BIG mistake .... finally lost my cool with a very drunk mid 40s lady at 04.00 in the morning who was telling wild and loud stories for 30 mins on the front steps of the hotel. She was the last of a number of similar groups that formed through the night. ,So bottom line... I will definitely go back to the hotel which above all has some very friendly staff and is comfortable. The public areas maybe a little dark and 'too red' for some tastes - its all sort of a modern take on smart vistorian - but I will be very careful which room I choose. Aim high up and don't be on the right hand side of the hotel  which looks down on main drag.,Only complaint otherwise was a mirror light in my bathroom which I could not switch off !

They were friendly, helpful, and at all times not only professional but also pleasant and cheerful.  ,  The hotel is well-maintained, clean, and up-to-date.  Many fine Dutch hotels, although they are located in quaint ancient buildings, lack some of the amenities that we needed for our stay.. like elevators.  The Carlton Square\\'s interior was not dissimilar from a upscale US hotel.,  On the downside, the location isn\\'t exactly perfect.  Although we did want to stay outside of Amsterdam both for cost and to allow us some peace and quiet away from the big city, this hotel could have been just a little better located.  It was a long, 2+ mile hike to the train station each day and about a mile hike to local restaurants, shops, etc.  Unless you\\'re very athletic, I wouldn\\'t suggest taking the 300 train and walking to the hotel with your luggage.  The cobblestone streets alone would knock the wheels off your bags.  A taxi from Schipol to the hotel is only 35 Euros and well worth it.,   There is a bus station a short walk from the hotel which can take you to the train station and back.  A tip... buy a \"strip ticket\" which allows you 15 rides on any bus or tram in the Netherlands.,   Another downside to this hotel was the food and beverage service.  The Whisky Bar in the lobby was seldom open.  There is only restaurant on the property.  We tried it the first day for the buffet breakfast and were disappointed.  Most European buffet breakfasts offer full choice.  This was two hot entres... scrambled eggs or bacon.  Other than that; several dry cereals, sliced meats and cheeses, and some breads.  You can do much better right around the corner at the \"Sandwish\" cafe or at any of the in town sidewalk cafes.,   We also tried dinner once at the hotel restaurant.  Also very disappointing.  They try to be a European \"Gourmet\" restaurant but fail in that they only offer seven entrees and they are served French-style with small portions nicely presented.  The price tags of their dinners was quite high.  Once again, many many restaurants available in town and of course in Amsterdam.,   As we were staying for more than two weeks, we went for the Executive Room which was more spacious.  It promised a daily newspaper, bathrobes, and turn-down service.  We never saw a bathrobe and only started receiving the newspaper toward the end of our stay and after we asked about it at the front desk.  We had turn-down service about 7 days of our 19 days.  Inconsistancy could well be the motto for this hotel.,   Another item to consider is the hotel, according to a desk clerk, turns its air conditioning system off between 1am and 5 am because the \"neighbors complain about the noise.\"  My guess is that it is done for economy.  Anyway, we were there late May-early June so it wasn\\'t too bad.   We did wake up each night around 4am to open the glass door onto the balcony as the room had gotten quite warm.  I can only imagine the uncomfortability if your stay was during hot weather.,   I would stay there again because of the staff and the cleanliness and overall appearance of the hotel.

       " ('We had some problems at this hotel, but in almost every case the staff could not do enough to make things right for us (special mention for both Suzannes - Blonde and Brunette in reception) - we had booked a disabled accessible room and this is what we got (1423) but found that the wet floor shower was well named. Take a shower and the whole bathroom floor becomes wet, and the water stays there as there is no angle towards the drain, this must be a known problem as there was a squegee mop left in there for guests to sort out the problem themselves??? After one night this was clearly unacceptable as my wife almost fell and slipped on the wet bathroom floor and i found it out of order to have to put shoes on to visit the lavatory during the night! In the morning I reported this to the hotel and they agreed and after a wait they allocated us another room and asked us to leave our bags in the luggage room. My wife was unhappy about this as she felt there was nothing stopping anyone helping themselves to our bags  if they felt so inclined as no one from the hotel checked this, they just handed over the key to the luggage room. So we said we would wait for our new room to be available.... and we waited....and we waited. Eventually about midday we were told the room is ready and given keys for the new room, and....... it wasn\\'t ready!,Housekeeping were dispatched to get the room ready and we were now visited by the hotel manager who apologised and gave us a voucher for a free drink in the bar for our experiences - thanks for that - but it shouldn\\'t have been necessary in the first place should it? However all the staff were so nice and tried so hard to be helpful we found it hard to lay blame on any person in particular for any fault. Our new room, although not rated as disabled accessible was actually more suitable as it was slightly larger and was easier for us to use. The beds were up to the usual Ibis standard - very comfortable to sleep in and the supplied extra pillow is appreciated. Free wifi is good and the least a modern hotel should supply.  Be aware this hotel charges an extra 16 Euros for a continental breakfast, which is a little steep for the meal as it is, and we found the other hotel restaurants equally not cheap, and so ate out, which proved to be a better option and way cheaper in the local town.,My final point for anyone from the hotel group reading this is the car parking charge..... 17.50 Euros per night per car?  Wow this is expensive, but understandable for an airport hotel, but how on Earth you can justify this  charge for a disabled visitor I would be interested to hear? (In your favour this charge was waived in our case - another bonus point for the local hotel staff) If a booking is made and it is clearly for a disabled room then parking should not be charged for in this case as it is obvious that if they arrive by car they have no other option and cannot walk to the hotel. And whilst on the subject, more than 2 disabled parking places would be better and some policing of their use as on no occasion was a disables pass displayed in the screen of the vehicles parked there, yet they remained there for the whole of  our stay (3 nights). Staff said they would look into this and ask for them to move, but as nothing happened, I suspect they parked there and have flown off somewhere to return at a later time.,All in all, the hotel is good, but it is what it purports to be, an airport transit hotel and not a tourist or town centre hotel. All we wanted was somewhere to base ourselves for our visit to Amsterdam and after or problems were sorted out this is just what we got and were happy with what it turned out to be. If it were not for the \"can do\" attitude and the friendliness of the staff I would not recommend this hotel and would likely stay at the Ibis Budget next door, but the overwhelming effort put in our behalf made the difference.

       " ('We attempted to book into the Hotel de Doelen in Leiden, and were referred to the Nieuw Minerva. At first glance, the hotel appeared quite worn and the steep stairs daunting, but we decided to give it a try for at least one night. This turned out to be a smart choice. As we became familiar with the area, the Nieuw Minerva was likely equal to the other hotels  in the historic Leiden center city area. The 2 star rating for Nieuw Minerva is accurate and fair. Here are a few of its strengths and also some suggestions for improvement. ,Strengths: The staff was very helpful and spoke perfect English as well as a number of other languages. Breakfast offered several cold plate options in addition to warm boiled eggs and toast (one side of the toaster is broken). The luxury rooms on a whole were comparatively large by European standards, but they could not be called spacious. The facility was generally well maintained considering it is several hundred years old. Canal facing rooms offer a charming view. The lobby bar area is adequate and prices are reasonable. ,Areas needing attention: Directions to the hotel need to be detailed from both the Leiden train station and from Schiphol airport. The directions provided at the Hotel De Doelen Web site could be used as an example. Due to the number of one way streets, directions to the Nieuw Minerva should cover both walking and driving approaches. (This is one tough place to find by automobile.) If you reserve a luxury room, it should include baggage placement in room (most guests would willingly pay extra once the stairs are seen). The stairs are narrow and steep and would be impossible for anyone with balance difficulties. The Leiden Medical and Science Museum is also an historic building and offers electric stair lifts without affecting the historic integrity of the property. Only a very few luxury rooms resemble the quality shown on the Web site. Our room (#14) was better than most in the hotel (photos attached).  We visited luxury room #7 on the alley side and it was smaller with different décor. Standard rooms are much smaller and spartan. Directions for the in-room TV operation need to be posted (especially during World Cup season). The TV remote control and manual operation defy logic. Bathrooms need grout work and scrubbing to remove mildew between tiles. The building has no air conditioning (nor do most buildings in the center city) and small portable AC window units would be a blessing during rare heat waves (as we encountered). WiFi Internet access should be installed.  The “community access” computer in the lobby area often malfunctions, is set up for Dutch language, and is often unavailable when in use by staff or other guests.  The noise level on both the canal side and alley is unbearable with the windows open. The hotel is near the university and on all but 1 of our 7 nights  in the hotel, students partied nightly until dawn. The hotel staff should be alert to this, especially on hot nights when all guest room windows are open. \"Quiet please!\" signage might be helpful. ,This may seem like a tough review, but the items mentioned would help a great deal.  Due to the Nieuw Minerva location, kind staff, and the building itself,  there is potential to make this property the leading hotel in the center city.  We believe the De Doelen and Mayflower hotels would offer little improvement. The Mayflower is located on a major square surrounded by late night cafes. It would be difficult to park a car nearby and the noise level may be much worse. The Holiday Inn(s) and Golden Tulip are located a distance from the historic city and would require a considerable hike to see the city sights.',\n",

It wasn't the best club lounge I've been in (I'm afraid I've been spoiled by the luxury of Dubai) but it was on the same floor so was really handy, especially for checking out, and breakfast (the choice was quite varied and the experience was hassle free given the small number of people with access to the club lounge).,Our room was very clean & spacious, modern in decor, and had a Queen size bed as well as a large desk & chair and a comfy chair with footstool.

The trains themselves are double-decker and have 1st and 2nd class carriages - they're really smooth-running & quiet.,Once you get into Amsterdam, you can walk to the various sights, or get a tram.  If you're going to be hopping on and off trams, it's cheaper to get a 'strippenkart' - we didn't bother this time as we walked to most places, but I think the hotels & newsagents sell them.,Due to being based at the airport, our return journey home was also stress free - no worries about traffic hold ups getting to the airport, just 2 minutes walk, and you're there.,All in all, it was a very pleasant and relaxing trip.\",\n",

French and Italian restaurants inside the hotel, as well as as an American Hamburger Bar open until late.  Tried the last one: Good food there and very friendly service.  The shuttle bus service is among the best of all the Schiphol airport hotels.  The last bus to most other hotels leaves from the airport at about 1130pm, which is really awkward if you want to spend an evening in Amsterdam since you actually have to take a train from the city in good time before 11 pm.  But the IBIS bus keeps going until about 0130 am, and then starts up again only a couple of hours later in the morning.  One drawback, though:  This hotel doesn't offer luggage storage, so if you're checking out in the morgning but leaving Amsterdam later in the day, you either have to check in your bags at the Central Station in Amsterdam, - or do an early check-in at the Schiphol airport, without necessarily going through security though.,I will definitely stay at this hotel again, though I would naturally prefer to stay more centrally in Amsterdam, if rooms were available at a more reasonable rate than is normal in that city.\",\n",

Several irritating little details missed like no waste bin in the room; rubbish curtains that don\\'t keep the morning sun out even when tightly closed (the material is just too thin); no luggage rack or other place to put the empty suitcase out of the way; and the shower comes dangerously close to flooding the room outside (I had to put a rolled up towel across the floor to stop the water pouring out - floor slope and/or drain are just not up to the job). Also, the 28 euro \"champagne\" breakfast doesn\\'t have champagne at all, just cheap sparkling wine. A reasonably tasting no-name sparkling wine for sure, but there\\'s absolutely no way you could get away with selling a \"champagne\" breakfast in the UK and then not have actual champagne. Also the breakfast in general was pretty average. They make a big thing of it being \"live cooking\" in their advertising but it was just a chef cooking eggs the way you want them (omelette, fried, etc) like every other hotel breakfast and nothing more than that. Coffee served yourself just from a machine in the corner. Getting cutlery to eat the average breakfast with was an absolute mission. Anyway definitely not the grand 5* breakfast they make it out to be.,But the little detail that interestingly annoyed us most was the coffee machine in the room. It\\'s an Illy (they seem proud of this on their website and advertise it as a feature of the room) but you\\'re only allowed two of the capsules it needs. PER STAY not per night. We went to the lobby to ask for coffee for our second night and were refused, told we had to pay 3.50 each. Guys of course if we can afford to stay at your hotel we can afford the unadvertised coffee surcharge but the point/principle is that we should not have to. Especially when you / the Illy company are making such a big thing of these coffee facilities being a feature of the room. And furthermore for the few customers that bother to come down to reception and ask about it and you can see that this one tiny money-gouging aspect is souring the experience, just give them the stupid coffee capsules to make them happy. If Illy is charging you for them at all it\\'s surely just a few cents, is it really worth irritating customers over something that costs you so little if anything at all? You change the toiletries in the bathroom each day so why so tight with the coffee capsules???,Oh and you can hear people running about in the corridor of the floor above as well, which to my mind pulls a hotel down below 5* rating too.',\n",

Compared to the prices of hotels in Amsterdam and near Schiphol the cost of €94.00 was as steal.  I arrived in Haarlem via NS train from Maastricht without any idea of the location of the hotel.  The VVV adjacent to Haarlem Centraal station was helpful with figuring out bus routes to the hotel and also to the Keukenhof flower attraction in nearby Lisse.  I was able to take route 300 (Zuidtangent) from a stop directly in front of the NS station for €1.60.  It was only two stops away as this is an express bus that largely travels a dedicated roadway from Haarlem to Schiphol.,The Zuidtangent stop is directly in front of the hotel.  While it doesn't look like much from the outside, I found the inside of the hotel to be quite pleasing and the rooms were enormous (especially for Europe).  The washroom had a bathtub and a large walk-in shower and was perhaps the largest hotel washroom I have ever seen.  ,After getting settled a bit, I returned to the lobby and purchased a KPN Prepaid Internet card for €10.00 (good for 24 hours).  This was about the only time I ran into problems because at first the desk clerk sold be a card that cost more than this that was only good for use on the PCs located in the lobby area.  I had made it clear to here (or so I thought) that I wanted to access the hotel Wifi in the lobby using my own computer so after I figured out that what she sold me didn't work I dealt with another desk clerk to straighten things out.  I was able to easily access the internet throughout the lobby and I used Skype to phone home without any glitches.  ,The next morning the Zuidtangent came in handy when I took it catch my flight at Schiphol for only €4.80.  Had I purchased a Strippenkarte the buses would have been even cheaper, but the drivers on the Zuidtangent accepted cash and were quite friendly and helpful (and spoke perfect English).  ,Overall, I found that this hotel was a gem that wasn't necessarily on the beaten path but transport to the hotel and then from the hotel to the airport could not have been more convenient.\",\n",

Unfortunately reality was a bit different on 20/12/2016  when we arrived at the destination after a flight and a long drive from Amsterdam.  The first disappointment must have been the construction site that the hotel is right next to as maastricht is building an underground bicycle parking  (offcourse we know this is not a mistake of the hotel). The girl at the reception -who was very nice and friendly-was all alone with the only coleagues available were the kitchen staff who she asked to assist us with our luggage as we had many bags plus baby and stroller.  We were surprised that a hotel like this doesn\\'t provide the appropriate assistance for such matters.,The suite is dated with floor carpets and wall paper from ages ago. The view from the balcony is great being right on the main road. It had a living and a dining area separated by a cabinet from our bedroom space (overall the suite is 70 sq meters),Room service is only available from 4pm to 9pm with a surcharge to serve whatever you order. ,The hotel lobby bar service was horrible.

       " (\"I have just returned from the Hague where we spent five days. The hotel has some advantages and some disadvantages that you need to know about. The advantages are: 1. It is relatively close to the Central Station. 2. It is brand new, it is safe and secure. 3. The design is quite bold and original. The closets have glass doors so you are more likely not to leave things in the room while packing out, even though I managed to leave something. 4. Each room has a safe deposit box, a hair dryer and a TV. 5. It is airconditioned. 6. From some rooms you can see the nice view of the city, including trains going to Amsterdam. Now the disadvantages: 1. Even though it is close to the Central Station, it is not a pretty walk. If you enjoy walking along the deserted streets and looking at all the skyscrapers and the construction going on, you will feel home. So imagine a fifteen minute walk with at least six traffic lights. 2. The hotel went a little overboard with safety. As you enter the elevator that is right across the main lobby, in order to press the button you need to insert your card. You have only five seconds to push the button once you insert your card. I understand it is for my own safety, but... it gets to you after a while. Also, once you are in the room, you suppose to keep the card in a special slot allocated on the wall so you can turn the ligths on. As soon as you take the card out, some lights go off automatically. 3. There is no door in the shower, and there is a window dividing the shower and the bedroom. The toilet door is made out of glass too. Okay, they are kind of opaque, but there are certain areas that are clear. So if two people are sharing one room, not necessarily family but colleagues, you cannot count on any privacy, especially in the shower since there is no shower curtain or a door. 4. The restaurant is good but way overpriced. 5. If you like wenge, everything from a table to a toilet seat, the place is right for you. 6. They asked us to prepay on arrival even though the company have already prepaid them the full amount. They did apologize and returned our money back, but we could use those 500 euros earlier. 7. They gave us 500 euros in one banknote, and nobody accepts those. I remember a while ago I was staying at the Atlantic hotel and at Park Hotel. They were much better in every aspect. For the price NH charges ( over 120 euros per night) you can find a much better place in the Centrum. This hotel is not for romantic couples or a family with kids.

However, it was apparent that a large number of people were left at the bus stop as the previous bus was not able to take them all. Never seen that before. In Holland people don\\'t wait in a nicely formed line, instead everyone tries to get on the bus at once, shoving and pulling. Needless to say, when the bus arrived 40 minutes later, as soon as passengers had gotten off, the push to get a seat began. With the bus full to capacity, there were passengers that had to stand during the trip. It is not far, perhaps 15 minutes from Schiphol to the Hotel. Passengers were nevertheless very uncomfortable and forced to hang on tight. The isle was filled with passengers and in the stairwell of the bus was a young family with a baby stroller. The father was carrying the toddler with one arm, while holding on with the other. The baby was in the stroller, with the mother and another family member balancing themselves inside the stairwell, near the exit. Once the bus arrived at the hotel, people took their luggage and rushed toward the entrance of the hotel, which has ONE large turning door. With people coming OUT and the masses from the bus trying to get IN, this turned into a bottleneck. And of course everyone had luggage, which made it slower and more frustrating. The check-in desk was as ready as they could have been, all counters were open and staffed, but it was no match for the sheer volume that descended upon the poor employees. With the pressure on the employees to check in the guests as quickly as possible, the result was robot-like service bordering on the \\'rude\\'. I was told to make a reservation on the shuttle bus for the next morning or I would not get a spot. Surprise: next morning the same scene unfolded, with way too many guests piling into the bus, and the driver did not check if anyone had a reservation at all!,We received a coupon for complimentary drinks in the Bar, which we appreciated very much and used to wash away the misery from the shuttle journey.,I recommend that the hotel management ride their own bus, at peak hours, and proceed to check-in. Before making a reservation next time, I will double check that improvements have been made to the Shuttle Service or regretfully we must stay elsewhere.,Which is a shame, because Hotel Valk Schiphol is an awesome hotel.',\n",

The following points were the main points of note during our one-night stay:,1. On checking in, I was asked for my ID, which I produced after a few minutes (due to an over-stuffed wallet - business cards, receipts, etc.)  to the muted, but obvious annoyance of the check-in staff.,2. We went to the bar for a drink after leaving the bags in the room In the room, we noticed that there was a mere ONE coffee cartridge for the coffee machine. This was rectified on request. We asked  were at the bar and the barman - in mid-order - disappeared without saying a word for a minute or two at the request of another guest who just walked in. The 3 beers we had cost EUR 22.95, which is fair enough for an alleged 5-star hotel. The price the following day (I put the bar bill on the room tab) was EUR34, due to a 50% \"city tax\". 50% of 22.95 is not 11.05!!!! ,3. I had a reservation at an external restaurant, as I was informed over the phone mid-week that the fine-dining restaurant did not open on Sundays!!! Five-star service indeed!,4. Upon returning to the room around midnight, I noticed that the room was very dusty, and there were feather-type pillows. Being asthmatic, I called reception to request a change of pillows and stated that the room was dusty, which, quite honestly is ridiculous! Replacement pillows came about 20 minutes later. I said I would be talking to the duty manager the following day.,5. The curtains in the room are very light material and let the light in substantially - for the light-sleepers. (No pun intended.),6. 10:45 am, the Duty Manager calls to the room to discuss the foregoing. Considering we had requested a late check-out, I found this to be a bit odd, that he would call to the room when a late check-out had been requested, indicating that we may have wanted to (and did) sleep late.,Generally, apart from the concierge (Priscilla) and the barman, there was an understated snootiness about the place.,My overall rating would be one star out of 5.

I found the website of Hotel Zenden in Maastricht and was enthusiastic and curious because the hotel was renovated by Wiel Arets and had won a design prize.,Me and my partner are also interior designers working in diverse market segments, including hotels, so I was especially curious about this particular hotel Zenden.,On the pictures it looked interesting. The pool looked very nice, with a couple of small children on the site of the pool. So we were looking forward to having a swim and and we bought a swim suit especially for this occasion.,But this all never happened.,We arrived with the car in front of the hotel, in a small alley. The \"owner\",  Martijn, was not there, but another man who was not involved with the hotel, but just with the \"sport\" facility, sat behind the desk in too empy - just cold atmosphere. Emptyness can be very zen and comfortable (and I know what that is – I traveled a lot in Japan in beautiful ‘empty’ ryokans) but this was more like entering a huge freezer. I checked in for me, my mother and son.,\"Oh\", said the man behind the desk. \"We do not allow children, nor do we give out extra beds\".,I was astonished, I said there was nothing on their site where that was clearly written.,On the contrary, on their site they gave a totally different impression. On the photo from the pool there are young children, which at least gives the suggestion that the place is also for kids. There were studios with kitchens and at the desk of the Hotel there was even a flyer;  \"Zenden Sports\" with different young children on it. ,\"No\", said the man, \"that is from Zenden swimming pool and Zenden sports school\",How vague is that? It is Hotel Zenden and on the site they are promoting the swimming pool and their sports facilities. But in fact they are separate, although all located within the Hotel.,The way the man hehind the desk handeled this situation was both clumsy and very unprofessional. I have not experienced this in my whole traveling career. He offered no excuse from his side, no solution from his side, nothing.,We came all the way from Amsterdam, three hours by car to have a nice night in Hotel Zenden. Then I said \"If my son is not welcome here, then we will not stay here.\" ,He said that he \"could not guaranty that they would not charge (me) the reservation\",He said, \"you\\'ve decided not to take the room\",Astonished, I replied, \"No we are not welcome with a child, so what can I do?\",Then he had to phone \"Martijn\" (the owner?) but Martijn was not available. He said that he could not do more and he would phone me when he had spoken with Martijn.,I still did not know what they would do. Are they charging the room?,Then he walked away into another room – left me alone at the desk, so that I could not hear what he discussed with Martijn. He came back and said, \"Officially, no children are allowed, as a result, families book two rooms – mother sleeps with one child and the father with the other child. We first had the policy not to allow children, but now we do accept them.,What? I was astonished again! Is this a hotel. Is this for real?! In the meantime I felt extremely unwelcome. It felt so terrible. For some strange reason, he insisted on showing me my reserved room. I reluctantly joined him, and he showed me something that really did not correspond to what was promised. It looked nothing like what was portrayed on the website.,Saddened, astonished and disappointed, I left with my mother and son and we travelled to Roermond to a ordinary hotel in the city were we treated as guests, as it supposed to be.',\n",

The hotel has a 24/7 reception, and the staff were quite helpful.  The rooms were located upstairs from the hotel or in the adjacent building.  I stayed in a double room above the reception.  I would NOT recommend this hotel for anyone with mobility problems.  The staircase ascending from the ground floor was almost vertical - I have never gone up stairs like these before! - and they were not helped by the small spiral at the top!  My room was quiet, despite facing the road, and I had a small walk-out balcony.  The beds were moderately comfortable - two singles pushed together.  The room was spacious and had a tv showing channels in various languages, including an English news channel.  A small single wardrobe was available to store clothes (about 6 hangers). A full length mirror and hairdryer were also in the bedroom, along with a small armchair.  The bathroom was small, containing a shower with curtain, handbasin and toilet.  The room and bathroom were all clean and functional.,Breakfast was served in the main hotel by two people.  Breakfast consisted of a basket of various breads, yogurt, some preserve and butter, and a boiled egg.  Tea or coffee and fruit juice were also served.  The breakfast was okay - nothing special but served it's purpose!  No evening meal/lunch facility was available and the hotel did not provide room service.,I would return to the Hotel Ouwi again if I was in Utrecht for business but it is by no means a plush hotel.

If, like me, you expect a high level of comfort and prefer it if your hotel has some character then this is the place for you.,La Bergere is a design hotel. The exterior is unremarkable but it strikes you as soon as you walk up the short coridoor to the lobby. Stark colours, sculptures and modern art let you know you have arrived. The reception staff are dressed very smartly but casually. Often they can be on the phone handling enquiries without you realising as they wear bluetooth wireless headsets. When they are dealing with you, they are about as firendly and helpful bunch as you can get. Depending on the time of day there will be a complimentary glass of orange juice or port, together with something to nibble, on the counter.,The rooms are on the small side but very, very smart. Some have water beds, all have widescreen TV's. The standard rooms have excellent showers, the deluxe  rooms also have a bath. (Personally I don't think they are worth the difference in price). The rooms do not have mini bars but a complimentary bottle of mineral water is always to hand.,Perhaps unusually for a hotel of this class (It is 4 star by the way, not 2 star as the heading here states) there is no bar open during the day and no restaurant. Given the proximity of so many fine eateries and watering holes this has never been a problem for me. Breakfast is a pretty normal buffet. I generally prefer to go to the integral cafe 'Simply Bread' which does great sandwiches, salads and coffee. There is a small gymnasium on the top floor.,The hotel is located a couple of minutes walk from the station and about five from the river. Once you cross over the footbridge here you are into the old center of town. In terms of location it is pretty well perfect.,For its combination of luxury and character this is my favourite hotel in the Netherlands (I live here) and one of my favourite anywhere in the world. Given the relative lack of facilities it won't be to everyones taste but speaking personally I can't recommend it enough. I probably spend 50+ nights a year in hotels, almost always 4 or 5 star establishments. This is one of the very few I truly look forward to staying in.\",\n",

No emergency or whatsoever. The collegue on the other desk helped clients. As I stood in-line for the priority deks, no-one even bothered to help me, or even ask if I needed anything. Was it because I am in a wheelchair? I hope not. ,Anyway, as the phone conversation finally had ended, I asked the woman in charge (who happened to be the supervisor of the front desk) how it can be that I have to wait even longer, now that I am in line at the priority desk. She didn't really have an answer. As I suggested that her collegue first helps clients already waiting at the priority desk before other guests that got in later, she said something like: 'We will look at your suggestion at our next meeting. Anything else I can do for you?',Needless to say, this 'Accor member welcome' didn't feel all that warm and welcome.

In the courtyard we were only 1 of 2 tables occupied on a Sunday afternoon.  We asked for coffee and got it, which was nice.  Although the 1 waiter on shift was pre-occupied with the other table and almost completely ignored us.  Perhaps because we had just ordered 2 simple coffees, and the other guests had ordered wine, food etc..perhaps there is a bigger tip in that.  Again, overall and very nice hotel.

They were each made up separately though, so they sheets and everything were tucked into each bed, basically so I had to choose which one I wanted to sleep in, but they were pushed together to give the appearance that they were bigger.  If you laid in the middle they just slid in opposite directions and you would fall on the floor in between them. ,I called the front desk and told them I wasn't happy, given that I was paying for an executive room instead of a regular one, and they told me they were completely booked and nothing could be done.  I pressed them a little, but they stood firm.  So I went online and tried to book another room in the hotel and found that there were rooms available for every price.  I called them back and told them, and 10 minutes later I was moved to another room of the same quality, but with a correct bed.  The rest of the stay was fine after that, but seriously, why would they lie to someone who paid?  If they had the room, why not fix the issue when it first came up?

The room was very bare with thread bare carpet.  The room was very warm and smelled really musty.  The bathroom was the worst bathroom I have ever seen.  It was something akin to a prison cell.  Pipes were exposed, the shower cubicle was horrendous.  The sink was so big that we had to squeeze past it to get to the toilet. I stopped counting the stains on the bed at seven.

After catching the bus and 45 minutes later, it drove back from the airport driving right past the hotel on the way to Aalsmeer!

It is well suited to a couple or solo travelers who want to see Amsterdam City but don't want to stay in the heart of it.

At check-in, done at a computer, the staff still came over to welcome me and to help me with the process.  The room was small but excellent!    I did wish for two small items, however.  It would be nice to have a coffee machine in the rooms and also a small bench or table to place your luggage and items.  Otherwise, you have a great concept and I hope to come back!  The staff gave me an excellent tip: For 4 Euros go back to the airport and take the 197 bus into town to Leidseplein square.  This will put you in the center of town close to museum quarter.  Free movies were good, too.  Stayed twice while I was in Amsterdam on this trip.',\n",

The location of the hotel, 5 minutes walk from Amstelveen Busstation, was perfect. With the 300-bus from and to Schipol, for 4 Euro each way. For going in to the city of Amsterdam, there was busses available all day, with max 5 minutes waiting time (Line 170, 172 and 174) Only 4 Euro pr person each way. It took from 20 to 35 minutes, depending on what time of day it was. ,The hotel was small, but clean, cosy and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful at all times. The breakfast was every morning a faboulus start of the day. The selection of bread and \"spreads\" was very good. And with fresh croissants and chocolate-brioche to the coffe, every day was a good day :),We also tried lunch the last day, and were sorry that we didin\\'t do this earlier. Please try the Bitterballen for lunch or snack!! We also had dinner there one evening, and that was the best dinner for the whole trip!! ,The surrondings of the hotel is placed in an area of residents (?), with peace and quite in the evenings. The garden of Alp de Veenen is small, but a nice place to have your morning coffe, or just a glas of wine, for relaxing after a long day in museums, art gallerys and pancakehouses.,If you continue to the end of the street (ask in the reception) there is an amazing chineese restaurant, with superb food and service. The kitchen of Alp de Veenen is closed in weekends, so they guided us to the best restaurants in Amstelveen. Try the Chineese!!,We also found the shopping Mall of Amstelveen, behind the bus station. Many nice cafes and restaurants, and a wide variety of shops. If you can\\'t find it here, you don\\'t need it.... ,Next time we are going to Amsterdam, we will stay at Alp de Veenen - our best recommandations to this pearl.',\n",

When one of us would complain about something, the other would say, \"But remember, this is a 2 star hotel!\",My wife and I (mid 40\\'s in age) stayed 9-10 Feb, 2007, which was just before Carnival.  The location of this hotel is fantastic since it is in the center of Maastricht within walking distance of everything. On the other hand, the central location can be a detriment at 2 AM Sunday morning when the roaming band marches through the bar downstairs as part of the pre-Carnival activities.  There can also be a fair amount of noise from the Markt Square, so you may prefer a room in the back of the building.,The room was very basic and the bathroom door was an accordian screen which might be used as a cheap closet door (But remember, this is a 2 star hotel).  The TV had a good selection of channels but the room had no phone and there was no pay phone in the hotel (Cell phones reign in Europe also).  Breakfast was OK but not outstanding (But remember...) and it was nice not having to leave the property for it.  The elevator was nice and modern, but it was permeated by a sewage smell which also wafted into some of the halllways (But remember...). Hopefully, this is a temporary problem.,The bedding and towels were adequate.  The bar downstairs, which also serves as reception was OK but smoky and there is a separate entrance accessed by an electronic relay chip attached to your room key.,I had a rental car which I parked at Magdendries public lot about 5 blocks away for 5 euros/day.  There were underground lots which were marginally closer for 19 euros/day.  There is a cinema called Lumiere on Bogaardstraat 40 located in an old church about 5 blocks from the hotel; most of the movies are in English with Dutch subtitles.,All in all, this is an adequate hotel in the center of a great city.

It would easily work for a couple too.,Kitchen area had sink, dishwasher, combo microwave/oven, fridge/freezer, induction hob, espresso coffee maker. Plenty of crockery, plates, cutlery & glasses and enough pots, pans and utensils. Not masses of storage for dry foods, but sufficient. Cleaning products provided (washing up liquid, tea towel, sponge etc). ,Spacious bathroom with deluge shower and hand held attachment. Separate toilet with small basin. The separate toilet is the only thing I really dislike about the room - but that's just me perhaps.,Lounge area with sofa and easy chair and large screen TV. There is more storage (albeit much of it above head height) which acts as a floor-ceiling divider between lounge area and bedroom area.,The bedroom area has a comfy bed and soft pillows, wardrobes (the reverse side of the 'divider') and a second similar flat screen TV. ,Food shopping is easy. 7-8 min walk to an Albert Heijn supermarket. Enough choice, but be careful - they don't take Visa or Mastercard so bring cash.,Public transport is quite convenient and very efficient. It's a 5-6 min walk from the hotel to Uilenstede stop where you can pick up the metro (orange line 51) or #5 tram. ,Metro line #51 goes to Centraal station with multiple stops but is pretty quick (30 mins). Alternatively, take it and change at Amsterdam Zuid to the faster (blue) #52 metro line which will have you into Rokin in about 8 mins.,Tram #5 - although re-routed and now no longer serving the city centre between Leidseplein and Centraal is a good option for the Rijksmuseum.,If you're making more than 2 journeys a day then considering getting a 24/48/72 hr GVB travel card for tram, bus and metro or a multi (calendar) day travelcard that also includes the train (useful for travel to/from Schiphol airport).,During my visit the train tracks near the hotel were being repaired so the metro 52 and tram 5 line south of Zuid were both out of commission and replaced by a replacement bus service. Even then this wasn't too inconvenient. When back up and running (due end August 2019) it will be dead easy to get into the city. It's also simple to get to Schiphol in under 30 mins (tram/metro to Zuid then train to Schiphol).,All in all, the Adagio worked very well for me - but make sure it matches your needs before booking. If you do, you'll be rewarded with a very pleasant stay.\",\n",

However, most of the guests seemed to have long transits and I heard one explaining that he had chosen the Yotel because it would have been so complicated to get a visa for the 20 hours he had to spend at Schiphol.  ,First, the check-in system is temperamental: no flawless Japanese technology here.  You have to use an airline-style electronic check in terminal and put in your code exactly as you received it.  If you make any mistake, it's not smart enough to match your name to a booking.  It sends you to the staff -- 2 people responsible for cleaning, serving the limited room service menu and resolving any issues with the reservations.  Obviously, they are over-stretched.,The technology failure extends to the rooms.  Despite following the complexs instructions (and the interactive help menu on the remote), I couldn't make my TV work.  No TV, no interactive system. No interactive system, no way to order a drink or food.  Rather than wait for the harassed staff, I drank the tap water.,It's not just the technology that stops the Japanese model working.  The guests are not well-behaved Japanese people.  These guests walk up and down the narrow corridors with screaming babies.  They shout at one another from room to room. It is far from restful.,Maybe Japanese capsule hotels are this noisy but -- if so -- it explains why so many guests drink so much before checking in.  I had booked a premium cabin as a colleague told me that you could hear every move by the guest next door in a standard one.  My premium was next to the Yotel housekeeping room which probably explained the terrible banging and grinding every 30 minutes or so but I could also hear the family in the room on the other side.  I used the complimentary earplugs but sleep was still impossible.  At least I did  not have to spend the night ,At 60 Euros for 4 hours, it was expensive and for a little more I could have gone to a conventional hotel landside.

That means that overbooking is not an accident at the Hotel Des Indes, but it is a pattern (think about how few guests write tripadvisor reviews).  It means it will happen again, and it may happen to you.  The only reason for such a pattern is a lack of hospitality orientation and a drive for the quick buck.  I can see why some people really like staying here (it is in many respects a nice place, and it attracts people who really enjoy this kind of surroundings and service), but really, is the risk worth it?,I was bumped to another hotel which turned out to be really friendly and customer-oriented, the room was better there (large, view) and the breakfast much better (it was oddly middling at the Des Indes, together with the pool - the rest was certainly fine).

The site is fairly peaceful though, with a large wood and walking paths just outside which was great for the odd run or stroll out. However, the trip into Amsterdam itself takes about 1 hour and if you go by bus you have to change in Amstelveen. This is fine for a day out but if you want to go out at night, finding the bus stop and staying awake on the bus is a real effort! Finally, our biggest concern is the attitude of the Owner. We stayed at the site a couple of times with our campervan and the second time my boyfriend, Mark stayed on his own as I had to fly back to the UK. I flew back to Amsterdam and met Mark at the campsite the morning he checked out. When I arrived, Mark was waiting with the van in the site car park. He had asked if he could wait for me there and it was about 1hour after checkout. Whilst we were chatting and getting sorted to drive off, the Owner came over and told us we had to move or pay for another day's camping. Although this was done rudely, we didn't say much but drove out the campsite gates and parked in the carpark outside. The Owner then came flying over in his site buggy and told us again that we had to move or pay more money. When I explained we needed to sort out our satnav and he couldn't tell us to leave a public carpark, he said it was still his carpark and we had to move immediately. Mark was in the back of the van trying to find our satnav and I was buckled in my front seat. When I said we would move in 1 minute as we needed to know where to drive with the satnav, the Owner totally lost his temper.  I was incredibly shocked and if Mark hadn't been there, I would have worried for my safety. He lept out of his buggy and came to the window. He swore at me profusely, calling me terrible names and then started to tell people around him what he thought of us. He then sped off on his buggy, still swearing and saying he was calling the Police, which he duly did. It was so upsetting.

We said we would not like to, since we were exhausted after a long flightand not sleeping the whole night as well as the whole day, so could someone come and collect the money from us?  After all, the hotel advertises itself as a super-luxury four-star hotel.

I\\'ve never encountered this before.  The whole attitude of the manager was that the hotel was doing us a great favour.

Is it not misleading and inaccurate to advertise oneself as a four-star luxury hotel when one is not willing to provide good service or be courtesy to one\\'s guests?  Had I known of these policies, I would never have stayed at their hotel, and I strongly feel these policies ought to be outlined on their Web site so that any traveller can make an informed decision regarding where they want to stay, and not be duped into paying a large amount of money for services which are then considered to be pending payment regardless.

The Amadeus is located in the Grote Markt (Market Square) above a café, diagonally across from the Town Hall. It is about a 5 – 10 minute walk straight down a series of connected streets from the train station. It is an efficient, comfortable, bed and breakfast hotel at a good price. The one caveat that must be mentioned is that the reception and hotel is on the first floor (second floor for North Americans) and there is no lift to this level. Once you reach the reception there is a small lift to the remaining floors. ,Our room was on the 4th floor; it was adequate for our stay. It was not large but not really small either, there was a queen bed, two chairs, two night stands, a coffee/tea stand, a wall mounted TV, and enough space to set our two suitcases. As we have experienced in other European hotels that have been converted to ensuite accommodations, the bathroom was quite small. There was a good shower stall, but you either had to stand sideways to the sink to wash your face or open the folding doors, overall, not a big deal. ,The breakfast area was on the 1st floor in the reception area, I suspect that it might have been a restaurant at one time based on it decor and fixtures. The breakfast choices were good and the hostess/morning receptionist (I suspect one of the owners?) was happy to make me coffee. Perhaps one of the best selling points was the view from the breakfast window. It looks out onto the Grote Markt and on various days we sat and watched the Saturday and Sunday Markets being set up and people going to work or school on Monday morning.

The rooms have been completely redone in a kind of colonial style that fits the building and the area. Smallish but well equipped bathroom with separate shower (with wide shower head). ,The common areas have been nicely renovated: grand, elegant and hip (especially nice bar). Good and creative lunch and dining menu. Breakfast is a good buffet (+ some à la carte dishes included), except for the jam and honey. Why not include in the  breakfast the delicious home-made jam served with the high tea (or a good English brand like Tiptree) + local honey rather than the tiny pots of industrial French stuff? High tea is a must, with three different teas served. In general, attention to tea is the best I have seen anywhere (with the Bristol in Paris). They even serve Chinese white tea with the turndown.,Fitness, pool and spa are small but adequate. ,Friendly staff, good service and no corporate atmosphere (in my experience, better than the usual Méridien hotel).,Smoking policy is slightly less dismal than elsewhere in the Netherlands: no smoking floors, no smoking during breakfast, no smoking section in the main dining room (makes no difference because smokers and non smokers sit in the same room) but smoking allowed throughout the lounge (where tea is served) and of course in the bar.,Probably the best option in The Hague (there are also a couple of good boutique hotels).',\n",

My first impression was of \"walking a plank.\"  The hotel is under some construction and surrounded by wiry fence.  To get into the front door, you literally had to walk on a plywood sidewalk that was so shaky, I was afraid to fall into the muck below.  I was given a room on the 1st floor.  I specifically requested a 2nd floor room (being a single woman and all), but didn\\'t get one.  Ok, I thought I could live with it, so I set my bag down, and went into town.  Going into town from this hotel, by the way, requires that the hotel shuttle take you to Skippy, and then you must get on the train. When I got back,it was now dark, and I was tired, but there was a huge spotlight shining directily into my room. You could see everything!  I could not block it out because the curtains were half hung.  I complained again, and was told I could not get a 2nd floor room because I already used the room.  I told the girl at the counter that I did not use the room.  I dropped my bag off and left.  I told her to come with me, and I would show her the room.  So she did.  I pointed out the spotlight (and reiterated the fact that I did not feel safe on the first floor), showed her the curtains, the spider webs with dead flies in them, and the leaky bathroom.  She finally let me switch rooms.  I was very glad, but angry that I had to go through all the rigamarole.  The 2nd room was not much better.  There were no bugs or leaks, but there was also no heat.  I was so exhausted that I just bundled up real good and fell asleep.  I found the hotel to be very unclean, and the staff extremely rude. I would NEVER recommend this hotel.',\n",

The only coffee which came with the room was decaffeinated.  Coffee with caffeine could be purchased in the lobby (1 Euro per pod).  Nespresso store in the attached mall gives free samples of coffee, and the store coffee is much more reasonably priced (0.35 Euros/pod).  ,PRACTICAL INFORMATION:,While not located in the city center, the location is convenient to everywhere.  ,• TO/FROM AIRPORT:  There are very frequent trains from the airport to Amsterdam Zuid station.  The train takes less than 10 minutes so it is easy to get to and from the airport for under 3 Euros.  It is a 10 minute easy walk from the train station to the hotel (about 5 blocks). ,• TO CITY CENTER:  There are several convenient options.

The rooms have the little luxury extras including a bathtub/Jacuzzi and toiletries etc. My only gripe was the shower was too small with no door, however this is a minor complaint. There's a generous breakfast buffet to suit all tastes, and the hotel is perfectly located - next to the Erasmus Bridge and near to several museums. There's a metro stop right outside the hotel and you can buy a 7 Euro day pass at reception. The Spido harbour boat company is also a short walk away (before the bridge) as well as several decent restaurants a 5 - 10 minute walk - I'd recommend 'Rodin'. As a guest at Mainport you have access to Spa Heaven and I would highly recommend a treatment with either Sharmilla or Liliane. Both are excellent and dedicated to their work. They have a real energy and have an intuitive sense of what you need. I hope Mainport retain their services as they are both a real asset. All in all, well worth a long weekend break to get away from it all and pamper yourself.\",\n",

WOW, what a truly magnificent ship she was steaming by us over the icy waters of Inside Passage. I longed to walk her decks one day and experience the stuff of legends.,Unfortunately, I was never able to ride her as a passenger. So when I booked a transatlantic crossing on her replacement, the M.V. ROTTERDAM to their namesake city, I thought I would finally get to see the one time pride of the Dutch Merchant Marine.  What a disappointment! All movement around the ship is controlled by electronic key passes and a security staff that L.P. Beria, founder of the Soviet KGB, would have been proud of. The security staff is everywhere.  And the most storied rooms onboard: The Ritz-Carlton Room, the first and second class dinning room, the theater, the Queen\\'s Room, First Class Smoking Room, et.al. are all off limits, even with the paid tour. What a disappointment! Attempts to see these spaces brought  rude scoldings from the security staff. While watching the video production \"The ROTTERDAM Experience\" a uniformed guard came in and said it\\'s closed for the night and shut it off without any apology. Entreaty to the hotel\\'s desk clerk fell on deaf ears. The security staff has the upper hand, and they gladly exercise it. ,The ship is a too far to walk to the city center, so there are two rather expensive restaurants aboard for dining. The casual Lido Restaurant and the costly Club Room. Entrees in the Lido Restaurant at dinner ranged from about 19 Euros to 23 Euros, and everything was ala carte. A bowl of soup for a starter was 9 Euros and the prices for various  green salads were about 15 Euros. The food was good but not exceptional. Also the waitress refused to bring tap water to the table, so we were forced to purchase bottled water. Her excuse was that a glass of tap water is only provided to those whom need it to take medicine.,Apparently, the ship is controlled by the hotel, the tour concession, and the catering company, and never the twain shall meet. The only relationship they have is that they are all located on the same ship. It\\'s a system that isn\\'t working, and the ship being in bankruptcy is evidence of that.

I had been looking forward to our visit, how wrong I was. ,The bar and restaurant area is large with plenty of staff. I estimate that the entire place was under a third full and most of the tables reserved. So we arrived to a sea of empty tables.,We told the waitress we would like to be seated and have a quick drink and snack. We were refused a table suitable for a couple with a baby. It was absolutely clear we could not sit at a high table. There was absolutely no reason to be difficult, particularly as we explained we were going to be gone within 20 minutes from the outset. The staff showed no desire to help us, be flexible or indeed find a solution to our need. Its is unforgivable to turn away a couple with a baby from an empty restaurant. ,The first waitress we spoke to couldn't help when the solution was simple. She had to go off and find a manager. When the manager came she was just as useless. She said exactly the same thing and offered us another crappy, unsuitable high table. All the while, there was a table of people sitting in the restaurant having drinks and snacks, just as we would have liked. The manager then said she would have to go and phone someone else! Who on earth she was going to speak to I do not know. Utterly inept. ,The experience was horrible. The staff have no charisma, no desire to serve. Hospitality zero. They seemed of the opinion that customers are there for them, when it really is the other way round. After two failed attempts to sort the problem we walked away disgusted. The staff are no better than automatons. They didn't listen, they didn't appreciate their customer and they don't deserve to be in business or receive a penny in tips.

It could be a cafeteria if you don't get caught up in the novelty of being on a ship. I have seen better cross channel ferries.

Train from the airport to the centre is very quick and it was always on time amazing transport system! The journey was about 15 minutes.

Only thing you can really watch is Dutch television and when asked about this the staff said it means it doesn’t work?! Well why have the apps on there then. And forget about mirroring your tv as you need to pay a hefty amount as the hotel do not give you a code. If you do want to use the tv I would say use a long hdmi port and take your laptop.

Budget hotels in the UK eg travelodge enable you to increase the temperature but in our room you could only go up to I think 24 degrees or something like that so it was FREEZING. Hotel staff could not do anything about it and when we asked for extra duvets we had to ask twice to check as they look quite long to give it to us. I would recommend everyone to take extra layers and wrap up because it felt like outside was warmer than in the room unfortunately. ,I will be going again in March and I will stay again because it is good value for money and it’s very close to the airport. I think it is actually a gem which people don’t look at because it’s not as close to central as other hotels but to be honest it is really nice.

Station Zuid is a main station and you can go pretty much anywhere you want to go from that station.,The hotel itself is NOT within a reasonable walking distance to well known tourist attractions such as the Rijksmuseum or the Royal Palace. You will need to stay in a hotel closer to the central part of the city if you want that. However, after a long day of walking the city, dodging bicyclists, and going on tours, I found it nice to be able to go to a quieter section of the city to get away from the hustle and bustle. ,The trains run frequently and it’s very easy to go every where you want to go in a short period of time by tram, bus, or Metro. I found it to be very convenient to go to the museums and other tourist sites from Zuid. Plus, it is very easy to take the Metro to Johan Cruyff Arena (M50 -  Strandvliet stop) to catch an Ajax match. Depending on your length of stay, you can get an unlimited use pass for anywhere between 1 to 5 days that’s good for the all of tram, Metro, and bus lines in Amsterdam. It’s very useful. ,The hotel itself is clean, well kept, with a comfortable bed and a good sized bathroom. The front desk staff is professional, courteous, and helpful.

       " (\"We booked the Haarlem Hotel Suite COUNTESS, which is a short walk from the reception office. Located up one of those famously steep Dutch staircases, the suite is at the very top of the building that houses a ground floor restaurant and a unit immediately below that is also offered by Haarlem Hotelsuites. It's a lot of space for the money, featuring two good-sized rooms, plus a bathroom with both a tub and a separate shower and toilet. There is a complimentary tea and coffee making unit with supplies, as well as LCD TV with satellite service and a DVD player. The small deck with a table and chairs overlooks St. Bravo church, which is the iconic centerpiece of historic old Haarlem. Daily maid service will keep you in clean towels. ,First, the bad news: we never got the Wi-Fi to work, so we hooked up in the reception area one morning to catch up on e-mails. We also never received acknowledgement of our reservation on the firm's website so we called to confirm a few weeks prior. Despite that, we were led to a different suite than what we had reserved, although it was quickly rectified by the friendly and helpful woman working the reception area, so all is well that ends well. Despite those few issues, we highly recommend Haarlem Hotelsuites and we would gladly use them again. The rates are extremely reasonable and there is much to be said for being able to walk through a nondescript doorway off the street and into what is essentially your own private apartment. ,Something to know is that Lange Verstraat, upon which this suite is located, is a very busy place on weekend nights and things can be fairly loud until very late. (We don't have a problem with that, but some people might.) This is also not the place to stay for anyone who has problems climbing stairs because it's two flights up and somewhere between a normal staircase and a ladder, in terms of difficulty. Suffice it to say that this suite is not handicapped accessible (and again, we don't have a problem with that, but some people might.) ,Now, the good news: this is nothing like staying in a hotel, other than the maid service and the ease of making reservations. You may never see anyone else who is staying at Haarlem Hotelsuites during your sojourn, since everyone has their own, independent digs and it's not really a hotel, per se; rather, it is a collection of apartments. You will be in the middle of the old town, which is incredibly picturesque and has far less of the seamy underside that is typical of Amsterdam. (We love Amsterdam; we're just saying you will encounter far less in the way of prostitution and drugs in Haarlem.) Haarlem is also far more Dutch, so English on the menus is not all that common -- though people speak it well, so it's easy enough to get assistance. ,If it's a nice day, you can take the walk from the train station by just pointing yourself toward the church, which is clearly visible. It's not necessarily a short walk, but it's a beautiful one. Getting to Haarlem Schiphol Airport is easy and inexpensive via the train system. Haarlem Hotelsuites is a wonderful way to experience a charming city and we're betting it will leave you wanting to come back for the unique experience that you are sure to have.\",\n",

They were not wrong, Cheapest room I could find was at Airport Hilton at € 330 + tax never mind I can claim it back and the rate I booked included executive lounge access so I could have something to eat and a drink before getting up at 4.30am for new connecting flight.,The Hilton is connected to the airport at the end of a very, very, very long gloomy walk way.,Check-in was painfully slow, three out of 5/6 desks at reception open and all three had customers who had issues, queue for check in was disorganised with people trying to constantly trying to jump line.

Brilliantly priced, it really was perfect for us. Let me break it down:,(before I do, can I suggest a brilliant app - Citymapper. This will get you around so easily telling you how to get to any destination with a  variety of options such as bus. tram etc.),Journey from the Airport:,Could not be easier. Now what is important is that you will be using buses for your journey into central and back each day from the hotel so at the Airport train station go to the main ticket office and ask for a Amsterdam & Regions travel pass. You can get 1, 2 or 3 day passes that start from the moment you first check into the hotel. We took the 3 day which was 33 euros and well worth it. It is important to get this pass for two reasons. One is that this works on all trams, metro and buses and across the different bus companies. GVB run most of them however the two buses that run to the hotel are Connexxion buses and if you get the wrong pass you will be forking out extra per journey. Secondly the bus stop that is right outside the hotel would be a 5 euro journey into town without the pass otherwise you can walk ten mins up the road to the Kalfjeslaan bus stop.,Anyway from the Airport you need to get the 300 bus which stops at Amstelveen station and then the 347 or 357 bus which stops at Graff Florislaan which is the stop outside the hotel. It would take max 25-30 mins and is so simple. The Citymapper app would also tell you which bus stand to wait at at the airport and at Amstelveen.,Journey into town:,the 347 or 357 bus both go into town and it is just straight all the way and a pleasant ride. During the day it will take 20mins to get to Leidsplein or get off the stop before for the Van Gogh museum. It would take around 35 mins to get into near Central station. ,Late at night you can get the N47 or N57 back to the hotel and from Centraal station it will take 25 mins max. These night buses are regular all night long so you dont have to worry about getting back home. The buses are never lonely. We didn't use a cab once with this pass.,The hotel:,So convenient that the bus stops right outside the hotel. The hotel is modern and tasteful. The check in was a breeze and there is a nice area where you can have breakfast in the morning at a rate of 14 euros which is a good price for what they offer In town the breakfast would not be of this quality and would be the same price. This is not a 24 hour hotel, they do not serve food after a certain time. Primarily this is a quality hotel to serve as a base for your exploration.,The rooms are of a decent size, but I don't think a family of 3 could fit in. There is a large flat screen TV which you can connect a USB to but it does not have smart capability such as Netflix etc. There is a Nepresso coffee machine which is great but you have to ask for cups, i'm not sure why this is not provided. An empty fridge and a safe are also provided.,The best thing about the room is its bathroom. Really tasteful and the shower is amazing. A large area walk in rain shower and it is great. Better than my shower at at home, I actually miss it!,The beds I think there can be an improvement as it is really soft and I think too soft. It needs to be firmer for optimum comfort but this I could live with.,The surrounding area of the hotel, there is no supermarket in the vicinity. Opposite there is a grill restaurant primarily open in the evenings more. On the right hand down the road is an Indian restaurant. ,Walk up to the right around ten minutes is a nice bar and grill and next to that is a Coffeeshop called The Border where you can buy weed etc but you cannot smoke there as there is no seating etc.,Probably a few mins bus ride is the Forest which we did not get a chance to explore but we should have.,All in all it was a great decision to have a nice comfortable and clean hotel a bus ride from town rather than pay an extortionate amount for city center grotty hotel.,As a 5 time veteran of Amsterdam, I love walking round the city and visiting the coffeeshops but this hotel has changed my mind about staying in central for terrible prices and comfort.

My friend and I made that mistake for two days on our recent vacation (August 2006).  What was wrong with the hotel?  Let me count the ways!,First of all, security.  The room came with a keypad lock.  There was no way to lock the room from the inside.  This means that the room has basically no security-- if anyone overhears what the code is, or sees the piece of paper it\\'s written on, they can break into the room with no problem whatsoever.  Some of the occupants of the hotel did not look entirely safe.  At night, there were strange thumpings and scratchings on the walls.  At one point during the night, someone started banging on our door and trying to open the latch.  I don\\'t know if they were actually trying to break in, or if they were just too drunk or stoned to know that this wasn\\'t their room.  My friend and I slept in shifts during the night, so one of us would always be awake in case something went wrong.  We even considered leaving the hotel to sleep at the airport, or leave our luggage in the lockers there.  Just forget about having a good night\\'s sleep at this place.,Second of all, the front desk staff.  Something was seriously strange here.  We were forced to pay for our whole stay up front, before even seeing the room.  I asked for a nonsmoking room.  We were told that since the hotel was full that night, they could not give us either a smoking or nonsmoking room, but would put us at the end of the hall, which might help.  Later on, my friend and I were in the lobby, and overheard a conversation between the front desk clerk and someone trying to check in.  The person trying to check in said that he had been given a nonsmoking room but wanted a smoking room instead.  The front desk clerk told him firmly that he had a nonsmoking room and that there was no way to switch.  The front desk clerk told ME that they didn\\'t have rooms that were either smoking or nonsmoking!,The smoking/nonsmoking room mixup was an annoyance, but another conversation we overheard was troubling.  One guy had checked in for five days and paid for his entire stay up front.  The front desk clerk (same as the one in the previous story!) told him that there had been a mixup with the room scheduling.  The front desk clerk needed to move the guy to a different room.  However, since he would be in a different room, he would need to pay for his remaining three days in the new room.  The guy argued that he had already paid for his entire stay.  He should not be double-charged for a room that he was now told that he could not stay in as well as the new room that he had been moved to.  The front desk clerk did not accept this argument.  I don\\'t know how the rest of the story turned out.  The guy seemed really upset, justifiably so.,The hotel had several other ways of parting you and your money.  Parking in the hotel parking lot was not free.  It was about 20 euros a day, even if you arrived at the parking lot at 21:30 (this tidbit comes from another conversation overheard at the front desk.)  A computer with Internet access was available for the extra-special low price of 5 euros for 15 minutes, or 12 euros for an hour.  There were no phones in the rooms, but there was a pay phone.  I could not get the pay phone to make international calls-- you could feed it money, dial in the number, and the phone would just not connect.  This was not because I was screwing up the country code or something (I had about a month\\'s experience using pay phones in The Netherlands and Belgium to call the US.  Trust me.)  However, even if the phone couldn\\'t connect, it would not refund you the money.  It cost me 2.50 euros to figure this one out.  They did let me look at the phone directory for free.  Have you ever tried to entertain yourself with one of those?  Right.,Now, to the description of the room.  This is where it really gets fun.  The room was smaller, more cramped, and dirtier than a college dorm room.  That\\'s saying a lot.  This is not a room for overweight people-- you won\\'t be able to squeeze around the bed.  The room had a bunk bed, and all surfaces other than the walls and ceiling were this ridiculous primary-color blue and yellow combination.  The so-called \"carpet\" was really hard plastic with some slightly fuzzy stuff on the top surface.  You know, like the fuzz on those fuzzy plastic bunny rabbits they sell around Easter, only less fuzzy.  The shower door was frosted glass, tastefully decorated with two strategically placed transparent circles, one about where your head would be, and one a couple of feet off the ground.  Forget about retaining your modesty if you drop the soap!  Actually, you could still see through the door, even though it was frosted glass.  For interior decorating, there was a piece of abstract art on the wall that looked like the Blue Angels flying in formation over the Golden Gate Bridge on a foggy morning --  in the black scuff marks on the walls.   The bed was hard, and sorta went \"thunk\" when you sat on it.  The sheets and pillows were better than airplane sheets and pillows.

The check-in process was fast and painless, and less than 30 minutes after walking off the plane I was in my room on the 11th floor.

Access is based either on your room rate (e.g., executive level rooms) or your status within the Hilton HHonors program (e.g., Diamond tier status).,The room itself was spacious and well laid-out, and the finish and furnishings were tasteful.  The room features a large flat-panel TV, a mini-bar, both an easy chair and a small sofa, and a coffee/tea set-up.  I particularly liked the desk set-up, which had good lighting and plenty of power outlets.  Wifi connectivity was very good with excellent download speeds.,The bathroom was one of the largest I've seen in a Hilton located in Europe.  Aside from being spotlessly clean, the bathroom provides a large vanity area around the sink, and both an enclosed shower and a separate tub.  Guests will find robes and slippers and a nice assortment of toiletries.,I was able to enjoy a good night's sleep.  The construction of the building allows no noise in from the nearby airport.

       " (\"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in May 2014. Being a luxury collection property we expected something special. They say first impressions are lasting impressions. We arrived by taxi - there was no doorman available so we took our own bags in - no big deal. Check in was fine and we reached our room to unpack. The room was very cold and we attempted to warm it up with the available heating options. It soon became clear that a cold draught was coming through a small ventilation shaft in the room ceiling immediately above the bed. We called front office to ask if the vent could be closed - answer no. Explanation was that the external ventilation shaft entrance circulated external weather conditions throughout the entire hotel. Outside it was raining, very windy and very cold hence the outside wind driving the cold air into the ventilation shaft and circulating that cold air throughout the hotel. Not willing to sleep under a cold breeze and risk catching flu we asked for an alternative room. We were shown two alternatives - one at the front with street frontage. Being a heritage building there was no double glazing in the windows so room was subject to street noise. We declined and took the second room, number 003, which was up the grand staircase (2 flights), through a door, then a second door then up a narrow winding staircase. The room was tucked away in a corner of the hotel but was quite large. The ventilation was above the door at the end of the bed and faced the television so the incoming cold air was blowing away from us. We ran the heaters for the entire time to keep the room at a comfortable temperature. All good from here - no. On both days housekeeping failed to properly service the bathroom either not stocking up basics like toilet paper or sufficient towels. Our requests for these items was promptly met but should not have happened in the first place. The room had 2 windows - it was raining heavily most of the time we were there and both windows leaked. We had a pool of water on both sills which ran over to the carpet. We alerted concierge who came and mopped up and assured us it would be attended to. Alas, the water was still running in when we left. On the occasions we raised issues with front office/concierge, they were addressed but the assurances we received that it would not happen again or it would be fixed never materialised - nice words but no actions. Next, the beds here have overhead canopies. Looks nice. I happened to knock the underside of our canopy with my arm when putting on a sweater and received a shower of dust and fluff. A look at the canopy top revealed a large collection of fluff that appeared to have been there for some time. When drawing the room curtains it was found they were in similar dusty condition. Given the location of this room my guess is that it does not get a lot of use and therefore is not regularly attended by housekeeping. If I am wrong here then housekeeping do not do a good job. The restaurant - there were two options here, the fine dining area and the area outside fine dining. We opted to sit outside the fine dining area. The food served was nice but again the service lacked what one would expect from a luxury collection propertyor indeed even a nice restaurant. We had to ask for bread, we had to ask for the sweets menu and were never asked whether we were enjoying our meal. At breakfast on the last morning, albeit we were early, there were insufficient cereal bowls so staff substituted with paper plates. There was one nice touch here in that a young lady named Kim looked after us each morning at breakfast, quickly memorising our friut juice choices, tea and toast requirements. She was fantastic. A lot more Kim's would have made our stay here more enjoyable. In the breakfast/dining area there were several chandeliers. The one above where we sat had several blown light bulbs. From an appearance perspective I would have thought maintenance would promply replace blown light bulbs - no. Was not a good look, particularly in this property. On check out the printer wasn't working so I had to have my invoice emailed - on checking, yes, an overcharge on a breakfast which was promptly reimbursed. Am I being too critical here with what I have said - probably. However, I have stayed (and lived) in 57 different Starwood properties, 14 of them have been luxury collection properties. This has been by far my worst Starwood experience. In summary, if you want a comfortable room without a cold breeze in a professionally maintained property and to be looked after by staff who seem to be enjoying their roles and displaying a service culture then DO NOT stay here.\",\n",

You could hardly move around in the bathroom, the storage space insufficient- no place to hang anything. Bringing the luggage to 3rd floor but then having no space to open it other than the bed is frustrating. The breakfast was good but the breakfast room kind of cheeky.

       " ('Firstly I would like to confirm that this is fairly nice budget Ibis, obviously quite new, and therefore the rooms are more appealing than other Ibis budget hotels we have previously visited (included another one on the same trip). ,However there are a couple of things you should be aware of, particularly if booking throughout 2019 and into 2020. The advertisement of the Kronenberg Metro stop for the Line 51 is not applicable for the next couple of years as this line is being worked on, therefore the hotel should make this known to guests booking within this time. It made the hotel more confusing to locate and the construction work being done means that guests have to navigate through housing estates to find the hotel - GoogleMaps is your best friend. Instead of line 51, from Amsterdam Centraal you need to take Metro line 52 and change at Amsterdam Zuid onto the tram line 5, and get off at stop Biesbosch, from there you will need to walk through a housing area to find the hotel as the main road is closed to pedestrians for the construction work. ,Also, our check-in experience was a bit bizarre as there were a number of people behind the desk however all were talking between themselves and when one of the members of staff were asked to check us in, she was extremely grumpy about having to do so and wasn\\'t all that pleasant to deal with. The rest of the reception staff throughout our stay were very helpful though and we did not see this woman again during our stay. ,Also BE AWARE the Check-Out time is 12:00 (midday). We had a male cleaning staff member knock on our door before 10am asking us to check out, we replied no, that we would be checking out at midday as per the check-out time. Later just before 11am the same staff member just WALKED straight into the room without knocking and again, told us to check out. We did make the reception staff aware of this, and they were apologetic, however this should not be happening anywhere, regardless of the class or budget of the hotel. It was extremely rude and obtrusive, had I been in my towel or getting changed I would have been absolutely scandalized. Please do not let them get away with trying to kick you out of your room before the check-out time that you are entitled to as you have paid for a complete stay and it is your choice to take it. ,I did think the pizza place which delivers straight to the room was a great bonus and the place itself was fairly clean, although the walls of our hotel room had a multitude of scuffs and scrapes all along it making it look quite grubby. ,There was no door hanger to indicate we would like the room cleaned so we were unable to have it cleaned throughout the duration of our stay, this was a bit disappointing. ,The hotel is quite close to a supermarket though, called \"Jumbo\" which is no more than a 8 minute walk from the hotel (again, google maps it!) and offers everything you could need for your own breakfast and lunches at an extremely reasonable price (4 x fresh, soft sugar donuts for 1 EUR!) we were very impressed and alcohol was well priced as well. DO NOT be fooled into pay 4 EUR (!!!) for a small bottle of water at the reception, this is daylight robbery considering the close proximity to the wonderful supermarket, (6 EUR for a bag of lays crisps which you can get for no more than 3 in the supermarket!) please try and save yourself some euros for sightseeing and treats and don\\'t waste your money on them! ,It was a decent stay however there were a number of drawbacks, already stated above.

The front desk is very efficient and friendly.  Comfortable bed and very clean bath room.  The room is very quiet even the hotel is close to a major highway.  The minor issue I had is the comforter is twin size instead of one king-size.  ,It is an easy 20-minute train ride to Amsterdam central station (€6.20 round trip).  I returned to the airport one night around 10:30 pm and three NH shuttles showed up for pickup at the scheduled time.  I reserved a 4:30 am shuttle to the airport on the day I left.  The shuttle was on time and the driver was very courteous.  Overall I am very happy with my stay.  I definitely recommend the hotel if you need to stay close to the airport.

I have a young family and our stay was pleasant the only down side is that its located quite far from the centre of Amsterdam and to get there we had to get the shuttle from the hotel to the Airport and then catch the train in to Central Station. I would rate the hotel as good but it has the potential to be very good.,I will now explain why I have rated it average / good and why it has the potential to be very good. ,I booked this hotel through bookings.com and asked some questions of the hotel,1. I was going to arrive in Amsterdam early in the morning (11 am) and was hoping to check in early before the standard 2 pm check in.,I was advised if a room is free on the day they would allow me an early check in else they could offer me a free secure baggage drop off.,2. I had book 2 rooms, 1 triple room and 1 double room and requested the rooms be close together however on arrival I was advised all the hotels triple rooms were on floor 2 and therefore they could not put the rooms next to each other,3. I had read reviews that had commented on the hotel shuttle bus which were not answered within a week of the booking. As my booking date grew closer I wanted to contact the hotel to answer my queries but their email is not listed anywhere so I had to make an international call.,After making the booking I did not receive a response so after waiting a week I decided to contact the hotel myself. However, the hotel website does not list an email address only a telephone number so I had to make an international call.  ,Advice to the Hotel: - they must list their email address on its website so international tourists can contact them.,The person I spoke to then answered all my queries and spoke very good English. The same day I also received an email reply to my queries.,On the date of my booking I reached the hotel by 11 am and unfortunately no room was free so we placed our bags in the secure baggage handling area and went back out.,Hotel Positives,Great shuttle service runs every 30 minutes at quarter past (15 mins) and quarter to (45 mins) from the hotel and every Half past (30 mins) and O'clock (00 min) from the Airport.,Hotel please note your advice of where to catch the shuttle is incorrect. As you exit the Airport there is a sign for hotel shuttles. There is a sign just outside saying Ramada Hotel Airport. However, the shuttle minibus (which carries 16 people) does not stop there. It’s across the road.,There are 2 Ramada Hotels in Amsterdam. Ramada Airport and Ramada Apollo. Be sure to catch the correct shuttle which is a Black mini bus with Red writing of Ramada along the side.,As the hotel is situated quite from centre of Amsterdam you will need to catch the shuttle daily to the airport and then hop on to the train into Central Station and vice versa for getting back to your hotel.,This is just an example of how the hotel is good as it’s a great regular service of offering a free shuttle to and from the Airport however giving incorrect directions of where to catch the shuttle from can cause a first-time visitor issues.,Priority for the shuttle is given to people who are departing for a flight. You need to book this one night before your departure with reception and you are given a priority pass.,Supermarket is 5 minutes away,There is a supermarket called Vomare Voordeelmarkt which is only a 5-minute walk from the hotel and has everything you may need. As it was very hot on the first day we bought water (500 ml) in and around Central station and this was costing us 2 to 2.50 Euros. We went to this supermarket each morning and picked up an iced cold bottle of water (1.5 lt) for 88 cents as well as snack such as crisp and sandwiches.,The only other amenity we found near the hotel was next door there is a health centre with a gym and squash court and a small restaurant called La Bocca serving pizzas which is 2 minutes from the hotel.,The hotel itself is clean and tidy and the staff are friendly and helpful.,I had read reviews before staying and some people had complained about the noise as the hotel is situated near the airport. But I cannot agree with those comments, we had a pleasant stay and there were no noise issues from outside.,Swimming Pool and Sauna,Great to relax and recharge the battery after a long day walking around Amsterdam,But parents please note this is not supervised so you will need to stay with young children,Hotel Negatives,The walls in between rooms are thin and we could hear the people next to us ,Bathrooms are small,The rooms are very open and spacious but bath rooms are very small,On the first floor when you step out of the elevator the directions of the rooms are listed and the room number is clearly displayed on the room door. ,However, on the second floor there are no directions you must work out for yourself where your room is located. Also, the room numbers are stuck on the side of the wall in faint red writing on a black background.

I guess every guest and every hotel once in a time experience a very unfortunate event. The art is to try to prevent it and when it happens to settle with the guest immediately. Exactly that did not happen here.,During my booking I explicitly asked for a quiet room (as well as a room with blackened windows). As the room that I was assigned to was too light (awakening me in the early summer morning), the hotel staff showed me 3 alternative rooms. Two of them were in the attic of the adjacent building, one on the ground floor in the building next to the main building (you have to cross a small courtyard from the main building). I took this one as the room was not as stuffy and cramped as the other two. How terrible noisy that room turned out to be, everyone passing I experienced firsthand: from passing pedestrians to bicycles, cars, trucks (even if Maastricht is not the busiest city in Holland) no way you could have a quite sleep, awoke at 6 due to a garbage truck collecting garbage it seemed).,That’s the problem with design hotels: the emphasis is on “design” rather than the number 1 asset of a 4-5 star hotel: comfort. Discomfort I had. I told this to the receptionist who handled the complaint well, unlike her manager who basically insinuated I was a liar when she told me that the staff told her that they informed me that the room (401) was at “street-side”, which was absolutely not the case at all. Rather than trying to accommodate me and compensate me for one of the worst nights in any 4-5 star hotels in a long time, they fall back into this bad, typically Dutch, habit of arguing with the guest rather then immediately resolve the problem, not making the guest part of a Yes-or-No game.  The manager, rather than compensate me to keep me as a returning customer, told me she would come back to me “after consulting with her staff” (the staff that showed me the rooms the evening before and –wrongly- alleged that he had told me the room was at “street level”. By the way even if true its not telling that the room is just noisy, there are numerous “quiet” streets in Maastricht). Why questioning the guest’s position that he was NOT told that this was a noisy room?,This treatment of my complaint was unpleasant and troubling, causing me not to come back to this hotel. Thank god for competition! Most unfortunately, I already made a booking at booking.com for next week which I cannot cancel. It will no doubt be my very last stay in this hotel. ,Suggestion for the hotel management: maybe restore the old consumer rule: do NOT argue with the guest, try to resolve the problem, rather than make the guest even more dissatisfied as he already is after having had a bad sleep by questioning him/her. And an absolute no-go: do NOT even imply that the guest is lying, ever!,(P.S after writing this review I have been able to cancel my second stay and get a refund from the hotel)',\n",

Sometime in the evening, the Internet connection inexplicably went out across the entire property. This lasted for over two whole days.

There is a convenient bus shuttle, and the trip won\\'t take you more than 20 minutes, so that was on the plus side.

The buffet lunch was old and dry for meat and sauce, several of the juice dispensers were empty, the general quality of the food was rather on the poor side, except for the small ice cream that was offered as an optional dessert. In the morning they had a very unfriendly member of staff at the buffet breakfast who had to be reminded to bring over the bowl with the bananas as he shouted at me for trying to use the line of the buffet which was still covered by cling film but otherwise seemed readily prepared - but this line also had all the items in good quality and no empty bowls on display, which was the reason that I requested the other line were filled up again (name of staff is known to me).

With the effect that one of their ground security staff in a quite demanding and harsh, loud tone addressed me if he \"could *help* me?!?\" - another way of saying that he preferred me not to be there, very obviously. I asked for a feedback form at the reception, being told they had none (very astonishing to me!), and the guy came over and said he was \"the manager\", and I could complain to him right away and tell him what I was not content with. Now, while I strongly doubt that any manager would be on duty as a ground staff at 5 in the morning, I also strongly dislike very obvious untrue stories being told to customers in order not to have improper behavior or service being reported. But I told him that I would find ways over the internet to place my comments, which now resulted in his laconic comment, \"you can fire me ...\", with a grin in his face.

Our sleep was already disturbed by the noise below us and above us as there is no insulation between levels but then the taxi came at 5am to pick up the revellers, waking us up again by pounding on the door. We got very little sleep the two nights we were here. The worse thing to happen though was that our car got towed out in front of the B&B. We made sure there was parking before we arrived and how much it was in messages with the B&B. Nothing was ever told to us about Saturday Market days that you can\\'t park in certain areas, not even when we checked in (we arrived on a Friday), which is when you would think someone would have mentioned that very important fact. One of these tow zone areas was out in front (the closest to their front door). This is where we parked. We don\\'t read Dutch so didn\\'t notice the sign that stated you can\\'t park there between 00:00 - 18:00 on Saturdays. We awoke on Saturday, which was supposed to be a day of celebrating as it was my birthday, to a missing car. The car was tracked down and the towing company wanted an extortionate amount to release it - €257.50! The owner offered us a free taxi ride as compensation knowing that they were at fault for not warning us. I wasn\\'t happy with this and told her that I also expected half of our stay back. She agreed to refund one night\\'s stay as well. We were still out of pocket and not happy with the damper that it placed on the day. As a result, the inconvenience of a late start and having to find alternative parking had a trickle down effect and affected all of our plans. We never ended up getting a cake for my birthday and we missed out on our dinner reservations and ended up eating somewhere else less disirable. She knew it was my birthday and I kept hoping every time we came back to our room that we\\'d find she did something to make up for this happening during our stay by providing a free bottle of wine or champagne knowing she had a whole wine cellar of wine and a fridge filled with chilled wine upstairs. She didn\\'t do anything but instead had a loud party with her friends, disturbing all of her occupants. I would never recommend this place.

There is a sign she has hung up on the wall that states \\'People will forget what you said, People will forget what you did, But people will never forget how you made them feel.\\' She needs to let this message sink in because she made us feel like we were nothing but a room sale for her.

The soft boiled egg was almost hardboiled. There was no love put into any of it. She also expected us to eat pouring yogurt over oatmeal.  Very odd. She dumped the contents of one fruit bowl that was leftover by another guests and combined it with ours on the table. She did this right in front of us and apparently thought nothing of it. That\\'s a bit unsanitary as we don\\'t know what that the other couple had done with theirs. Breakfast is not worth the €10pp. In fact, I\\'d go someplace else for breakfast. It\\'s not really a B&B is it, if they charge for breakfast? Also, some of the amenities were lacking; there was no bin in the room so we left all of our trash on the glass desk to be cleaned up.

We chose this facilities because it is located within convenient distance to downtown Amsterdam. My experiance with this particular hotel is basicly at level 0!!!!! Unfortunatly at my second stay in the hotel my iPad touch was stolen from my room. After I found it out I reported that to hotel reception and local police station. I also gave them a map with current location of my iPad ( thanks so app \" Find my iPhone\") which I thought would be very helpfull. There was a proof ( I was told by security) from hotel access card who had an access to my room. For a next couple days while I was staying in the hotel nothing was solved eighter from the hotel side as well from the police. In the mean time my parents emailed the hotel many times and there was NO RESPONCE. My parents attached to the email a map with exactly location of my iPad. After returning back home I tried to contact the hotel via email for about 2 weeks. AGAIN NO ONE contacted me back in this matter. Then my mother made couple phone calls to the hotel trying to talk to the reception, on duty manager even the head of security in the hotel. Every time she was forwarded to someone, explaining the whole issue to every single person BUT no one was able to help us out. Finally after about 3 days of trying to talk to someone my mother was able to talk to Mr.Ron De Groot hoping that the head of security will be able somehow help us out. We were informed that the official letter was sent to our home address. After couple days we have received letter from the hotel saying that we should use a safe in the guestroom and there was no unauthorized entry to the room. Then we try to talk to the hotel security couple more times with the same effects as above. We even asked to speak to hotel General Manager by sending couple emails with request to schedulle a telephone appointment but NEVER no one get back to us. CONCLUSION : I have no iPad, the hotel does NOT take any responsibilities. In my opinion the hotel response to the situation is unaccetable!!! This is NOT a treatment we are expecting from 4 star hotel. I think I gave them enought proofs to easily solve the problem and find my stolen iPad but for some reason they are avoiding me.

They told me later that it is almost waste of money, but of course you can wash hands and rest on the bed. The hotel should use a normal booking system that clearly specifies the maximum number of people in a room at any time.

Don\\'t get me wrong, you are shielded completely from anyone else in the room by the cool oval shaped room walls as well as a pull curtain if needed, but it still kind of feels like you are going to the bathroom or taking a shower in a public restroom (NOT in looks - the shower itself is amazing - two shower heads one of which is raindrop). But, if you are alone or with someone you are comfortable with (as I\\'d hope was the case since you\\'ll be sharing a bed), this shouldn\\'t be too much of a problem. ,The lobby is amazing as well.

Another call to customer services finally achieved an email address for a member of the NH Atlantic team, who, following several emails, promised to investigate my bill. After another few days, the hotel confirmed the error and agreed to pay me back. Here I thought my issue was resolved but sadly not. After another week, calls to my bank and a number of calls to the hotel, it was identified that the payment still hadn't been made. That day the hotel confirmed they would transfer the payment and 2 days later, around €40 was refunded, but I was still owed over €180.

It takes a couple of minutes to work out the lighting but you may find it quite romantic in the end!,They must have had many problems before with the minibar, to have decided to make it so complicated to use it, if one ever does! The fridge is locked and is only unlocked by presentation of a card for a deposit! The complimentary water (only for the arrival day, which I find rather stingy!) was in the fridge and we had to ask 4 times to have it open - wouldn't it have been way simpler to have the bottles standing on the table and avoid the annoyance?,And when you do need to put something in he fridge, any fiddling with it reflects on charges on the bill at check-out. There is an empty shelf in te fridge, assumingly for guests to put whatever they want there - the question is why choosing to complicate and annoy guests?? That was the only issue we had, and others do complain about it here as well, the stay was absolutely eventless!,Breakfast wins by both presentation and assortment, all looks and is very fresh, and I had never seen so many kinds of granola before! Buffet differs between weekdays and weekends, obviously to reflect the higher rate paid by businesspeople during the week.,The hotel also offers a pool and a sauna, great idea for chilly days.,Whether as a basis for travelling around or for a stay in the city of Eindhoven itself, this Pullman is a very wise choice!  Just park your car elsewhere and don't come any near the minibar, hahahahaha!\",\n",

Thus, you didn't know when the bus was arriving to plan. Having such a tiny vehicle serving so many people from  2 hotels, means that the chance to get in the bus is tiny. All 3 days, I had to catch about the 3rd bus in the row in order to be transported - This means that you have to queue about 1-1,5 hour. In addition you will be literally squeezed with 7 other people. I reported the issue to reception - The personnel had both rude & helpful employees. The excuse was that their main shuttle bus was broken/needed repair, and we had to rely on that tiny bus. No information about that prior to my stay, no sorry for the inconvenience from the hotel stuff. Asked to leave hotel next day - they didn't bother to arrange/let me leave - I had prepaid them. I ended up paying taxi each time to get timely/safely to airport (about 20€ each ride). Keep away from this hotel no matter how cheaper is from the neighbor hotels. You will end up with stress, wasting time on transport and paying at the end more money on taxi.

Airport accommodation in the Schipol area is generally extortionately priced and with the exception of the Sheraton and new (and surprisingly reasonably priced) Citizen M a long way from the airport terminal.,The Yotel still had the smell of new plastic and freshly cut pine when I stayed there, its located next to the food court in Departures 2, i.e. the area for non-Schengen flights. With a boarding pass printed out at home via the internet, my passport and Yotel booking confirmation print-out I was able to get through passport control no problems the night before my flight and settle down straight away. When entering the non-Schengen area of Schipol there are no security checks (these are made at the gate), so its OK to bring in bottles of drink etc.,I opted for a standard cabin lower, this gave me a single bed in a bunk-style, with a television at the foot of my bed. Fold-away tables and chairs were available to hang my clothes on, next to that was a walk-in toilet/shower area. Although a bit cramped in the living area, the bathroom area was fine, the only problem being the horrendous slurping/gurgling noise any time went down the drain from the toilet or sink. The room was a bit hot at first, but the air-con seemed to work fine.,The only window was one in the door looking into the corridor, the blinds gave the option of completely open or completely closed. Despite the fact that I suffer from mild claustrophobia I was perfectly happy in the cabin and got a good nights sleep, with no disturbance from other guests at all, and I was wide awake for my early flight, for which I'd of course already checked in, so no early morning rush.,Soft/alcoholic drinks and snacks are available 24h from reception, who are ever so helpful, but there's no fridge in the room.,The price is an absolute bargain considering how much one can pay at other hotels nearby (a room at the Sheraton would cost 5-6 times as much) and for a good nights sleep they're worth their weight in gold.,Hopefully the Yotel empire will continue its march.\",\n",

Sure, it's not the biggest rooms, but it was ok for 2 people. The beds were comfortable. A double sized bed plus another single size on top, so this room could fit 3 people. The toilet and shower was separate. Shower was small. Once you leave the shower, you are in the room, so there is no privacy to get changed. Towels were clean and of a good quality. The shower was excellent, hot water come straight away and the water pressure was good. There is free WiFi and it works well. The tv was good. There is no fridge in the room, but there is a microwave in the lobby if you wanted to buy something and heat it up. There are no shops nearby, so my suggestion is to eat at the airport which is only about 5-10 minutes away. The free shuttle service is good. From the airport, the shuttle stop (once you exit, go right to the end), near arrivals door #4. It comes regularly and on time, starting from 5:06am in the morning from the hotel to airport, with the last shuttle from the airport to hotel at 1:15am. The shuttle bus is a big bus (like a regular bus) which is good, it stops at 3 hotels, Ibis Budget, Ibis & Novotel. Make sure you get off at the right stop. The Ibis budget is the first stop.  I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel. I always ate at Amsterdam Airport which has plenty of food choices and supermarkets as well. Check-in was efficient and check out was just a matter of walking out. To enter the rooms it was a keycode. This was a great hotel to stay at for my travel to Amsterdam as I used the free shuttle to go to the airport and then caught a train from the airport into Amsterdam City centre (15 minutes by to train to city centre Amsterdam Centraal & regular trains). This hotel was also very cheap. A much cheaper option than to stay in a hotel in Amsterdam City centre.

It isn\\'t very nice, it isn\\'t even nice, it is diabolically bad. Does KLM not read reviews of hotels they use? I will now be contacting KLM at the highest level demanding they take this hotel away from their stranded passenger hotel allocation. So ok, I arrive here very tired, without baggage because KLM has booked it through to my final destination, at 11:50 pm Friday evening from the airport, and as a solo female travelling on business I took and paid for a taxi even though I could have waited for over 40 minutes outside the airport for a free hotel shuttle bus.(Funnily enough I don\\'t put myself at risks in this way) I was wearing business attire that I had been wearing since 7 AM and yes you get the picture - I only have what I stand up in and what I have in my handbag. Admittedly reception were initially courteous, directed me to the restaurant but actually I didn\\'t want to have dinner at midnight but the restaurant was still just about open which is good news I guess if you like to eat late. So, thinking ahead, I got a large bottle of free water with my nice voucher and then thought I had better check that there is an iron and ironing board in the room so I can press my only clothes with me that I am wearing so I can travel back the next day at least looking fresh, oh and are there toothbrush kits in the room? Oh dear, nothing as basic as a toothbrush, and as for the iron, there is one in a public room for about 200 visitors. Despite an increasingly irate discussion with the Front Desk Manager they did nothing to help - they could not bring me an iron, they could not provide me even with a dressing gown so I could wear that en route to the public ironing room with my clothes. I told them this is the first purported 4 star hotel I had experienced which could not provide me with an iron in my room. By now I am exhausted, angry and thinking, as a frequent business traveller, I am not familiar with this totally inflexible, unhelpful type of \\'service\\'. This is just about 2 Star, not even the purported 4 star. So I go to my \\'cupboard\\' aka room for the night, it is tiny with the most unwelcoming, musty smell, the air conditioning doesn\\'t work, there is no plug in the basin in the bathroom (if I can call it that, it doesn\\'t have a bath) all the mock wood surfaces are chipped and have cigarette burns on them, there is no room service, no gown or slippers, but a very large TV! I was too tired to check to see if it worked, the room was smelly even though it did seem clean, and the bed linen at least was fair quality even though the bed was small and I didn\\'t sleep well because of noise. The ironing - well I went to the public ironing room in my underwear at 5 AM in the hope that I would not pass anyone and even this one iron had a security chain attaching it to the wall. Now I don\\'t normally stay in the sort of hotel when guests are treated as potential iron thieves but at least I left the hotel looking fairly fresh. I left the hotel for the airport fairly early (I couldn\\'t face breakfast there) as I couldn\\'t wait to get away and guess what - on arrival home KLM has now lost my luggage! The summary of all this - KLM - if you inconvenience your passengers by messing up their flights, at least try to redeem yourselves by ensuring you put your guests up in a decent hotel. This hotel does not fulfil that. I am not the only KLM stranded passenger to be annoyed at the poor standard here. I understand that we cannot expect 5 star which is my normal standard in hotels but at least check and ensure your guests (without luggage) at least have the basic overnight comforts and requisites. This hotel does not provide this and I will never travel with KLM again or stay in a Van der Valk hotel and I suspect about 2000 potential visitors to this hotel will read this review and then decide to go elsewhere, at least I hope so.

       " (\"We stayed at this hotel last summer when we came to watch Andre Rieu and couldn't have been happier. The service, the room, the food was faultless. We were so happy to rebook and decided to upgrade our room to deluxe. When we arrived, however, we found that our room was a dark long shape with virtually no natural light. As a claustrophobic thus was my worst nightmare. We mentioned my problem to the reception staff who apologised but sId there was no room to manoeuvre. This left us with no option but to stay out of the hotel for as long as we possible as I physically was unable to stay in the room for any length of time. Such a great shame that this spoiled an otherwise lovely stay in Maastricht. I know the hotel has lovely bright airy rooms but I felt that I was in a prison cell. \",\n",

       " (\"i went to this hotel this week and have arrived back a couple of days ago, and to be quite honest, while reading these reviews i was really not looking forward to this hotel at all as most if the reviews are bad. i don't know where to start really. first of all i must give the hotel some credit for the cleanliness of the bedrooms and hallways they were exceptionally clean and always tidy. however, the bar area and breakfast area wasn't as clean and the floor looked quite grubby like it hadnt been swept or mopped for a long time, but the breakfast was actually pleasant, it was rather basic though, bread and cereal was on the menu every morning and that was about it,but the fact that we could make a packed lunch for our outings was a nice idea and the hotel gave us lots of cartons of drinks for the week. the dinner was mostly alright. we had chips almost every night and the soup was literally just lots of water with stock cubes and about 100 teaspoons of salt in. the soup was watery and very salty but it didn't actually taste too bad. one night we had a curry which was actually very tasty. on the first night the manager came to speak to us and being 12-13 year old teenagers we was very excited because it was our first night and we was talking and didn't realise he was trying to talk to us, so he shouted really loud at us and told us we don't need to be so loud and i think that wasn't a good attitude to have to a large group of children who have payed to come on this trip and we are giving him custom, the waiters/waitresses were nice though, an could speak very good english. one time someone in our group rang the reception bell because they needed a member of staff so one lady came up and started shouting saying we can't ring the bell and told us off even though we needed a member of staff. it was such a disgraceful attitide! that night a boy was feeling restless and decided to have a lay down in the bar chairs then the same lady came along and literally dragged him out of the chair and told him to wake up and she handled him really roughly. overall i think the hotel was very clean but the rooms were too small and the showers were tiny and not even enough room to move about, there was balconys on some rooms and they were very stable and safe and looked nice. i think the hotel is suitable for a big group of school kids but not a family who are thinking of having a nice time. i recommend another hotel that is actually opposite aan zee and looks much nicer. so if you are looking for a luxurious hotel PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE YOU WILL BE DISSAPPONTED.\",\n",

It was just astonishing how bad the service was. ,On arrival nobody new anything about the gift and we were asked to pay the full amount (though our friend checked and double checked because already on the phone the service was very strange). As we said it was a gift they acted as if we were crazy and really offended us as if they did not believe it could be their fault. Later the fax of our friends was found but without the credit card number, (and she checked by phone if the fax was readable and they  had said no problem). In the end after several phonecalls we could go into the room. No excuse was made. After that all the extras were missing!!!! No champaign in the room (this was supposed to be a suprise for us from our friends) so we had to call again and again to ask for all  our 'suprises'. Later a bill was presented AGAIN. I got so angry I asked for the manager and I also mentioned that another suprise was the breakfast in the room. He said if you want breakfast served in your room you have to fill in a form. Again I had to tell him that this was a SUPRISE so it was already arranged. Then he suddelnly told me oh I found it. The next morning we were waiting for our breakfast (after the discussion with the manager) but it did not came!!! went down and again they said we have to fill in a form.. ???? Anyway the only thing they did was apologize while I expected at least a bottle of wine extra or something. It seemed like these people did everything to ruin our weekend.

My last stays were not good. They were bad, in terms of service and the lack thereof. ,I've encountered several problems the last months with my room, the facilities and the service.

Mistakes happen. But I was particularily put off by  the fact that when checking out the last three times, I was no longer asked if I enjoyed my stay but simply told: see you next week. It's a recurring syndrome in many hotels and restaurants: as soon as you keep coming back, the service goes down and you're taken for granted.,The fact that our employer pays for our stay does not mean my colleagues and I should be taken for granted.

       " (\"I recently stayed at this hotel with my partner (26-28th September) first impression were very standard hotel, definitely not 4*!! We had booked a superior room, apparently 2 single beds pushed together with separate duvet covers counts as a double bed! Before checking out of the hotel I noticed a 100ml bottle of Christian Dior perfume and a D&G bracelet had been stolen from our duty free bag (purchased on the ferry as a present from my partner)!! Straight away I rang reception to tell them and was called back by the deputy manager. I found him extremely rude and not understanding at all. I was trying to explain to him what had happened and he constantly spoke over me almost implying that I was lying about the items stolen. In the end I had to hang up the phone as I was in tears and he just wasn't listening. After checking through all of our belongings again we noticed a bottle of vodka (also purchased on the ferry) and my partners £500 Hugo boss watch we're missing from the duty free bag! I was told by the deputy manager he would call me the following morning. 4pm the following day, still no call. I had to call the hotel, from England costing me an absolute fortune! Once again I found the deputy manager extremely rude and once again the call finished with me in tears. I was told the manager would call me within 24 hours. 2 days later I receive an 'email' informing me the hotel could it be held responsible as these items were not in the safe. I had already explained to the deputy manager my perfume and bottle of vodka would not fit in the safe. Why when staying at a 4* hotel should you need to look your belongings away especially a bottle of alcohol? These items were in a bag, not just left on the side or on the floor, no body should have gone through any of our belongings! Only 1 person had entered our room from the time we left til the time we arrived back to the hotel, this was the chamber maid! In the words of the deputy manager she had worked there many years and was a trustworthy employee! Obviousky not. Between the first email stating a thorough investigation was taking place and the last email stating they would not take responsibility for the items stolen was a 9 hour gap! I don't believe for 1 second a thorough investigation had taken place. I'm absolutely disgusted with the hotel and definitely will not be staying there again! This was supposed to be a nice weekend away for my partner and I but turned into a complete nightmare. I've never had anything stolen whilst staying at hotel whether it be 3* or 5*, and this has definitely put me off! Having £750 worth of items stolen to just be told 'sorry' is not good enough! I had asked twice for the police to be called and not once was this done! Terrible hotel, terrible customer service (from the deputy manager) terrible experience!\",\n",

       " (\"I had to change hotels mid-business trip the last time I went to Rotterdam because of the coachloads of tourists checking in each night at my usual hotel so I transferred to the nHow in Rotterdam for a 4 night stay.,The front desk is contained within a complex and it isn't a separate building so it can be a bit confusing to find when coming up from the car park underneath - the car park is operated independently and not exclusively for the hotel but you can get your parking charge added to your room bill each morning when leaving the hotel rather than pay at a machine or queue behind other car park customers.,It is a bit disconcerting that the hotel is one tower out of a 3 tower structure and they all share a ground floor. It means that you are never quite sure if you are going somewhere that you aren't meant to.,So, first the good stuff - it is a clean hotel, relatively new, plenty of rooms, plenty of parking underneath with a car entrance just 50m down the road from the hotel entrance and pedestrian access from the ground floor of the hotel. The hotel is very conveniently placed for access to all parts of Rotterdam. The hotel is spread over many floors of the building and the lifts are fast. The food in the restaurant is actually a very high standard and I was impressed with the quality. The breakfast is nothing particularly special for Rotterdam but it is good, comparable with hotels like the Hilton. The attitude of the staff is friendly and cooperative. The beds were comfortable and I got a good night's sleep each night I was there. One of the benefits of being on the 14th floor is that any roadworks nearby won't disturb you. The room was well cleaned each day and the housekeeping staff were unobtrusive.,The view is very good from some rooms but from others it can be a bit ugly or intrusive depending upon which side of the building you are on. Being on the North or East side is probably the better choice.,The wifi was acceptable. Nothing special but it worked.,Not so good stuff - someone has decided that leaving bare concrete columns around the hotel is, in some way, arty or acceptable. In fact, it just makes the hotel look like it is still being built. Buy some emulsion guys and paint it. ,I think it was 3 days before I saw a grown up in the hotel behind a desk. Every staff member seemed to be an 18 year old Dutch blonde girl and, whilst this is not necessarily a bad thing, it doesn't give you the impression that you are talking to anyone with any authority or a person who can actually address your issue without going and talking to someone else. More than once I had the feeling that they were giggling at me behind my back in a foreign language as I left reception and I generally didn't feel like the female reception staff were professional enough.,It was the same in the restaurant - the staff were enthusiastic and helpful but wandering around like lost lambs and so inefficient when it came to servicing the customers although the food, as I mentioned above, was excellent when it arrived. Only one in three of the restaurant staff looked like they knew how a restaurant worked. They were mostly very reactive and never proactive when it came to service.,The rooms are full of reflective surfaces and the bathroom is a glass walled wet room. Why on Earth I need to see into a bathroom from the bedroom area in a hotel room I don't know. It's obviously meant to be innovative and in some ways it is. The door to the bathroom when opened acts as the door to the toilet so when you have an open bathroom door, it is a closed toilet door. That is innovative... for one night. Then when you get up in the middle of the night to stumble into the toilet, you realise that a glass door is something to be feared because you are forever hurting yourself by walking into it and forgetting if it is open or closed.,The giant screen TV is obviously meant to be some kind of internet enabled smart room facility and mine was just rubbish. There are no instructions and I am an educated person with a couple of degrees but I just gave up on this thing after a while. It is a bit like a Wii, with the remote control being a like a Wii controller - except that it wasn't calibrated properly and I had to leap across the bed to get the pointer to move much. And the TV is so highly polished that it is just like a giant mirror pointing at your bed (again, maybe OK for some but not me) and it is too heavy to try to move somewhere where it doesn't just make you feel like you are staring at yourself instead of the TV picture. It makes the TV almost unwatchable because of screen glare.,My particular room looked directly out on to the office next door in the second of the three towers which meant that you had to be really careful on a morning in what state of undress you opened the curtains because the office inhabitants start arriving before 07:00 and you could easily find them staring at you when you first open the curtains.,The restaurant is also the breakfast area and the first impression of it is that it is very cheap. It looks like it has been filled with lawn furniture and has plenty of bare concrete columns. The whole thing looks like it is temporary and unfinished. The signage about where to go is generally tiny and seems to change regularly as it either moved or disappeared whilst I was there. I am sure that someone has sold it as some kind of contemporary arty concept idea but it doesn't work and it just looks like someone is trying to do the hotel on the cheap. It needs a good dose of class and expensive furniture to turn it around.,My minibar wasn't filled back up each day if I took anything from it and the minibar itself was housed in a wardrobe type structure that didn't close properly and had a light on inside it all the time and seemed to be shoddily constructed of some very cheap and nasty material. It meant that the light shined through the open cracks in the wardrobe all night and if you got the angle wrong in bed then you got a beam of bright light right in the face from the wardrobe like the aliens were coming to take you away and subject you to a 'probing'. Frankly, it sometimes seemed like a welcome alternative...\",\n",

It was very hot those days and one morning a genius decided to lift up the outside curtains, so the room was exposed to sun all day. Once we came back, we asked to put the curtains down but nobody was able to do it. After two hours (and many other complaints) finally they managed to put the curtains down but in the room it was already 30-35 degrees. The result was that we did not sleep all night because of heat. The day after we got our third room but we had to convince the personnel before getting it (\"we have only executive rooms\" was one argument: and we had booked an executive room.....).,Breakfast is poor in quantity and quality (Dutch standards...). Furthermore the tables are always dirty and full of dishes, spoons, forks, glasses, used by previous guests, simply because they do not have enough personnel to clean the tables. They do not have chairs for children.,The only 2 good points are the location, in a beautiful park, and the free internet.',\n",

This taxi runs 3 times a day (10.30, 19.30 and 23.50). Consider the roomrate, this hotel is really good-value because it's very hard to find such a good-quality hotel with spacious room for 98 euro per night in town center!

Next morning after we spent a night on 2 beds three of us (which was not a problem, actually as we always sleep with our child like that) the owner of the place uncovered this and it lead to a huge confrontation with him. The person doesn\\'t manage his temper and in no way should be named the hospitality provider as his status should be. The person intimidated us, humiliated us in front of the rest of the staff and as we gave up to threats of calling police (which was a bluff, and later we thought it would have been better they intruded), after tears of my wife he overcharged us for 1 night (of course, the rest of the stay we cancelled) not respecting the on-line deposit we had paid before and evicted us before the check-out time.,In general the whole situation amounts to a full administrative legal case with inflicted damages on human dignity as the assaulting side was vocally denigrating us, offended and even threw personal belongings.

       " ('Probably it’s a too long report of my experience in this hotel, but I hope you can find some help about how to behave, in case you still decide to go.,First of all, I do not know which are the rules (?) to release stars over there in Noordwijk aan Zee, but this is DEFINITELY NOT a 5 stars hotel. To be generous, it could be a 4 stars and certainly it is far from a 5 stars level as far as its desk staff is concerned (this taken alone would deserve 2 stars at most). Instead, there is no doubt that the  prices of the services are at a 5 stars level:  A) Breakfast: if you have not included in your package, it costs more than 22 euro per person, so I suggest you to get your breakfast in one of the cafes 100 metres downhill (it’s around 12-14 euros for two persons) and to conveniently save money for a nicer dinner/lunch in some restaurant. B) Internet: the hotel has wired and wireless connections, but not owned: it’s run independently by Swisscom, so you have two choices. The first is to spend 10 euros for a limited traffic amount: I don’t remember how much (but not much), but be careful because this amount must be used within 24 hours, otherwise you have to pay again (don’t trust the hotel’s employees: they do even know how rates work). The second choice is to use the PC workplace (there is only one workplace, and some unknown genius placed it just beneath the reception desk, so you can imagine the level of privacy you have) connected to a printer and to the internet. Here you pay per time of use: I spent almost five euro for writing a 8 lines e-mail and sending it. C) Parking: costs a lot (more than 20 euros per day: if you park the car about 800 metres far from the hotel, for instance in Rembrandtweg, it’s free…at least in June 2009..).,I reserved through my Expedia internet account a double superior room for 2 persons and 4 nights (from Monday to Friday, therefore not including the weekend, when room rates in Noordwijk are raised to levels comparable to those of Capri in summer). As many you may know, the room reserved in this way has to be paid in advance: rooms had a different cost per day of the week, but in total I paid 567,97 euro plus 29,12 euro visitor tax at the check out, therefore with a daily average of 149.25 euro per day, breakfast NOT included. ,I reached the hotel with other two friends that had other two separate single rooms (not superior de luxe, but “simply” de luxe). The basic “visible” difference was the price, and indeed this was my first surprise, since they paid around 90 euros per night. I visited their rooms and, exception made a couple of square metres less, their rooms were quite similar to mine: they included also a team shower with eucalyptus oil (wow!), like my room.,Before leaving, I had read the description of the superior deluxe room in the hotel website (http://www.palacehotel.nl):  “In all rooms, however, the living and bedroom areas are separated. All our superior deluxe rooms have 2 TVs, of which 1 sits atop a pop-up television cabinet at the foot of the bed. Thus you can enjoy your favourite TV programme from the comfort of your bed just before going to sleep...”. In the case of my room, this was absolutely false: the bedroom and living room were in the same area and there was only 1 TV (actually this was not a problem for me, but this was the real thing). The room was at the street level, and from one window I could see a quite ugly street with the monstuous “Hotel ter Duinen” (who authorized its construction should be arrested) in the background, and from the other window a parking lot, which is not bad at all for a deluxe superior room. From the same website: “Too, all our superior deluxe rooms, with the exception of the corner rooms, are equipped with a shower and a bath. And, of course, 2 washstands…” Obviously I had got a corner room and one washstand only…,The nicest surprise, however, was the telephone: I had 3 (three) telephones in my room, but no one working. I needed a telephone to call a toll free number for telephone calls abroad at reduced rates (I had my pc with me but, as I said, forget the convenience of using skype for tel calls with the rates mentioned above). So I went immediately to the reception desk to complain: the guy at the reception stared at me as if I were a fool, since I was asking to fix a phone problem in a 5 star hotel at 9.00 PM. Obviously, I had to wait next morning. As far as the room was concerned, he checked and said (smiling with all his available teeth) that it definitely was a deluxe superior room and there had been no mistake. Conclusion (mine): there is a mistake (or lie?) in their website. The morning after, I reported the telephone problem to the reception desk again (obviously the brilliant guy of the evening before had left no note) and they said they would have solved. When I came back in the evening, phones were still not working. Back to the reception: no one knows anything and a girl takes a note (where shall they throw all those notes?). The morning after I asked again the clerk at the reception, and she called a lady that seemed to be a staff chief: after I recalled that I had been asking to solve the problem for 2 days, she told me without any sense of shame “we know that there are rooms where there is no way to make telephone work”, and the only thing she could do was to change my room. Avoiding to be too rude, I recalled her that I had to leave the day after and changing the room now wouldn’t have been very comfortable and clever. When I asked why they did not tell me before, she said she was not aware of the problem.,This is just to give you an idea of the level organization in this hotel where the right hand does not know what the left hand is making and viceversa, so you’re warned. ,The most important thing, however, is to ask to be informed what they are doing with your credit card. In fact, two weeks after I had checked out, a payment though my credit card (a mastercard) was rejected because of insufficient credit. Going on my card’s website I found that I had only 140 euro credit instead of the 750 that I should have had, so I called the Mastercard helpdesk and they explained to me that there was a sequence of amounts (one for each day of my stay: 200, 99.80, 99.80, 77.40, 135.60 for a total of 612.6 euro) that had been safe-blocked by Palace Hotel Holland Noordwijk aan zee, despite of the fact – as I said – that I paid for my stay in advance. The helpdesk suggested to contact them. So I did, and nobody replied to me for three days. Then I sent a second email. The extremely irritated and threatening tone of my mail worked: this time I got an answer, with some generic excuses but also pretending that they had already answered to me (false, since I did not find anything even in the spam mail), and that they had talked to their Mastercard helpdesk which had found no blocks in my credits card, and therefore they could not unblock anything. Then there was a very strange request: “Is there a possibility to get your contact details so we can contact  you by phone.! This would make the communications a lot easier.” I called again my Mastercard helpdesk, and they confirmed that Palace Hotel had blocked those amounts: more, they told me that they blocked each amount for 21 days (which never occurred to me before with an hotel, especially after having paid in advance!). I wrote again to the hotel, and the same lady replied very rapidly (interesting how now email communications worked smoothly now) starting with a sentence that tells everything about the sovereign confusion that rules in that hotel: “Unfortunately you do not wish to provide me with your contact  details, therefore I can not contact you personally to explain the  situation to you”, and insisted repeating the same things written before. ,I guess I don’t need to continue.',\n",

If you want to check in earlier it will cost you more (in my case 8 euro more).

The hotel is just across the square from the station, but the location is very quiet. The hotel’s website needs updating, as it fails to mention that coffee making facilities are now available in the room. On the down side, the advertised restaurant has now been downgraded to a bar. Most of the local restaurants are around the town’s main square, which is an 8 minutes walk, but there are a couple of cheap and cheerful restaurants just down the road from the hotel. Breakfast was fine, although the staff were a bit wayward in replenishing supplies. Generally speaking, though, the staff were really helpful. If you’re travelling from Schiphol, it’s worth taking the number 300 bus, from door to door, although you have to keep hold of your luggage as there are no luggage racks.

What I really needed a space to withdraw, relax and rest; I certainly found that here. ,Complimentary WiFi meant I could work as well (public WiFi, no password, so use your own VPN if you need a secure connection). In addition to a large fixed desk the room also featured a small portable side table to use with either the armchair or the bed. ,As for the hotel's location, both the central train station and the town centre are within walking distance, but buses from and to those locations (as well as the nearby hospital) stop right outside the hotel as well. There are a number of supermarkets virtually on the doorstep, as are the cinema, a small shopping centre, riverside promenade, restaurants and fast food outlets.,I found no major negatives to my stay, but I do have a few remarks: it was clear my no-smoking room had been previously used by a smoker, judging by the burn marks on the desk. Secondly, the wall-mounted soap dispensers in the bathroom weren't great: the one for the hand basin is too far from the basin and harder to push because of it being on the side wall nearly out of reach, while the one in the shower marked as containing 'shampoo/shower gel'... well, that didn't feel like shampoo to me, more like hand soap. I ended up buying shampoo from the nearby supermarket to use instead. ,Finally, it was nice to have a small empty fridge to be able to stock with purchases from the various supermarkets within walking distance, as room service seemed overpriced (€5 surcharge per item with €10 minimum surcharge on top of typical room service prices seems a tad over the top) and the hotel's own bar/restaurant, 'Timeless', appeared to have no staff on Friday night (there must have been staff on duty as one table had drinking guests, but I didn't see anyone), and it would have been convenient to have had a menu/price list in my hotel room. Next to 'Timeless' is the restaurant '22High'; staff there explained it didn't belong to the hotel (wouldn't have been clear to me otherwise) and neither the menu nor the buffet particularly tickled my fancy, but on arrival I was tired and so I ate there anyway. ,Again, these are only minor niggles, no complaints, and the really important aspects (clean room, good bed, good bathroom, working WiFi free of charge, and the option to switch of air con and open a window instead), all those things that truly mattered were tip-top.\",\n",

       " (\"My review is based on the comparison to other hotels I have stayed in Eindhoven.,I don't like the gym which is down into a depressing basement with no windows and not so good & minimum equipment. It was really hot in the gym and no wonder I never saw anyone using this place. When I reported this to the staff but nothing was done to make the air conditioning work.,The swimming pool is basic but again no sauna, steam or jacuzzi so I didn't use the area.,I didn't like the restaurant food, but the bar area has a nice atmosphere and the food is simple but better. ,Breakfast is fine but disorganized. ,Did not find a TV channel menu in the room and when I reported to the staff they asked me to come downstairs and pick it up from the reception. TVs and quite basic & small and it takes a good 4 seconds to go to the next channel.,Hotel is located at a good long walk to the city and another hotel I stayed had there own bikes that they offered free of charge to the guests.\",\n",

       " ('This is a very large Ibis.  I paid €129 which is OK for an airport hotel, I suppose, just a little steep for an Ibis.  There is a free shuttle bus to / from the airport and there is a 24 hour coffee shop snack bar as befits a place with people coming and going all the time.  The reception is busy but efficient.  During my stay there were no problems.  ,The rooms are pure Ibis - modular, clean, light.  The soundproofing is adequate so that the noise of aircraft does not intrude over much.  There are several restaurants  from fast food, through pizza to more formal arrangements.  The breakfast buffet is very good.  ,WiFi in this hotel is provided by an Orange hotspot which you have to pay for.  There seemed to be adequate and secure parking but bear in mind that most guests do not arrive by car.',\n",
       "  'Low'),\n",
       " (\"I arrived with a booking that (unknown to me) my corporate travel company had cancelled. The reception team could not have done enough to sort it out and check me in (luckily there were rooms and I actually got a better rate!). Then my key didn't work (ever get the feeling you shouldn't be somewhere?!) So I had  to go back to reception and they actually came up with me to sort it out. Felt like the most annoying person in the world in my head (the staff certainly didn't make me feel like that)  ,The rooms are not frilly but the best type of functional. Enough hangers, water etc. Possibly a kettle would be a welcome addition. ,Controlled by an iPad, good selection of tv and great lighting. ,Eating is buffet style around the bar (although there are plenty of tables and chairs around for your own space). Food was good (although breakfast a little expensive compared to dinner). ,The ambience in the communal areas is very nice. You can mingle or be on your  own. ,The staff are absolutely the hotel's best asset. The room is lovely, the food is good, the space is well designed; but the staff are something else. Super friendly. Happy to help and explain (if it's your first time you need a little explanation about the food etc). Really cannot fault the hotel, especially considering they must only get short stays which would make some hotels lazy. \",\n",
