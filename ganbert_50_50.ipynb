       "[(\"Do not even bother going to this campsite, the owner was rude beyond belief!,We turned up at Camping Hostel Amsterdamse Bos on Sunday 11th March looking forward to staying at a nice Campsite that was near enough for us to get into the centre of Amsterdam easily.,We had driven from the VW show in Ninove Belgium, that happens every year, with some friends in our 2 Splitscreen campervans and another friend who was in a kit car. ,Because it was low season my partner emailed before our stay to ask if it was ok if we stayed there and he was told it would be absolutely fine. He was advised that reception closed at 12noon and the barrier would be down but it would still be fine to park up in the hard ground parking area and walk in to use the amenities. ,After a long drive from Belgium we arrived at 7.30pm and within 5 minutes of us arriving an extremely angry and rude man marched outside demanding to know what was going on and what all the noise was.  The noise was in fact the sound of our engines driving in and parking up, being old vehicles they are not the quietest.,My partner tried to explain that there would be no more noise, we were just parking and the engines were off.  He explained he had emailed in advance to check it was ok to stay and that he had email confirmation telling us to park up and pay in the morning when reception was open.  The angry owner was having none of it, he  said he was not interested in any email and that he had the right to tell us to leave and that he was telling us to leave.  I thought, being a female, if I walked over and tried to reason with him, that he could see it wasn't just men and he may see sense.  He did not.  I told him we were not here to cause trouble, that we wouldn't make any noise and that we had just travelled a long way to get there. He told me he didn't care and that we weren't welcome and to get off his land, his campsite was for proper campervans. If two 1960's beautifully restored Splitscreen VW campers are not proper campervans then I'm not sure what is!!,The owner of this campsite must mentally unstable, or have serious anger issues, as there was absolutely no reasoning with him.  He was in a complete rage and shouted at us constantly in a very threatening manner to get off his land.  I was not at all surprised when visiting trip advisor to write about our experience that other people had suffered similar experiences.  I only wish we had checked trip advisor first and not bothered with this place at all.  ,We could have perhaps slightly understood if we had arrived at midnight, without booking and being very rowdy, but we weren't.  We booked in advance, from the UK, described our campervans and arrival time and we're promptly and aggressively told to leave.  What a complete waste of our time!  The only good thing he did was tell us to go to Zeeburg campsite which we did and in comparison was absolutely lovely.  Good value, welcoming and friendly, great facilities and close to the centre of Amsterdam, I only wish we had gone here first!,So don't bother with Camping Amsterdamse Bos and go straight to Zeeburg.\",\n",

       " (\"Remember if you found this review Helpful to check on this was helpful link at the bottom (Karma!).,So I had to transit in Amsterdam and booked this hotel for 1 night.,On their web site there is a shuttle schedule posted from the airport to the hotel. The shuttle also makes 2 stops before at other hotels in the area, but there was a video map with our location an estimated arrival time displayed. The schedule was accurate and it's about 10 minutes to get the hotel from the airport. The shuttle runs beginnign at 4:00AM and stop around midnight with frequent departures every hour. Check the schedule.,The shuttle is a bus, was large and easy to find at the hotel shuttle pickup area for Schiphol.,I checked in around 2:00PM which is check in time is scheduled for. All rooms at the hotel are non-smoking. When I checked in at the front desk I had specifically inquired if there was a charge to make local calls (calls to Amsterdam) to which the receptionist said there was no charge. Upon check out I learned there is a charge, and it's charged by the minute, so keep that in mind.,Breakfast was not included with my reservation and it also wasn't open when I checked out but the restaurant did look nice.,If you do want a bottle of water the front desk has a kiosk. It's 5 EUR for water.,The room itself that I received was on the 5th floor. There were no sounds of plans landing or taking off that I noticed. The furniture and carpeting seem to be a bit dated but I was staying only for 1 night. The bed was comfortable. I was single and I think it was a king size.,The bathroom too was also spacious however the shower wall is glass and moveable so remember not to bump in to it and in fact you want to position it so that it's angled so that water has a higher probability of going in to the tub. If you position it so that it's parallel to the tub, chances are water will be pooled on the floor when you're done with your shower.,The desk has the standard European outlets. I didn't check with the front desk to see if there was an adapter available. They offer free WiFi and it worked very well. There was also an ethernet cable on the desk but it was just to tease me as it the Local Area Network didn't function and the cable end was broken anyways.,There is also a pay parking lot if you have a car. I'm not sure how much it is but it was 0.50 for 3 minutes. The parking ticket machine that you will need to validate is located in the lobby by the front entrance.,The pool, sauna, and steam room are located in the basement floor (-1). There are M & F changing rooms and lockers available but the Sauna & steam room were CoEd. The pool did look inviting if not for all the discard towels about. I didn't bring a swimming suit either. There was also a bar area in the ground floor that my room key could not open.,The hotel has several meeting rooms available too and it looks like they could handle small business gatherings.,Back to the room, there is an in room safe that could hold a laptop computer, and also a mini fridge available. I had bought a 1.5 ltr beverage bottle that would fit in the fridge at an angle as I couldn't remove the shelves from the fridge without removing the ridge from the cabinet.,Around the area there seemed to be a lot of nothing but again you can take the shuttle to Schiphol, and then get a train ticket to either Central Station (5.10 EUR) or Amsterdam Zuid (3.70 EUR) and then get an all day tram/bus card for (7.50 EUR) from the driver. Trams 51 and 5 will take you from Amsterdam Zuid to the Central station. Amsterdam zuid is also where the nearest major hospital is (VU university medical center) ,For me the only reason to book this hotel is price. If you want to spend more time seeing Amsterdam, stay closer then the airport, but if you are just spending the night then it should be ok, but keep an eye out as they charge you for every extra.  They did offer to remove the phone charge but I declined and stated that I rather they train their employees better.,Remember if you found this review Helpful to check on this was helpful link at the bottom (Karma!).\",\n",

       " ('I came to this hotel with my school, with Jemma who wrote the review below. My first impressions of the hotel were okay, the lighting was good and the heating was good. We used the stairs which are slim, and rather dangerous, to go to our rooms. The rooms are tiny, there are two small single beds and a bunk bed, leaving no space to move around. The temperature which was welcomed when we first got inside quickly became unbearable as we got settled into our rooms. Our bathroom was decently sized, but compared to our friends bathrooms it was huge. The shower did not work as it came out in small gloops, at extreme temperatures that either scolded or gave you hypothermia! The balcony was jammed shut but we did have a nice view of the beach from the window, although the balcony looked rather unsafe and the only protection was short wooden fence posts, definitely not suitable for children to be protected by. Two out of 4 beds were broken, and my bed completely caved in leaving me spending the night on the hard floor, the beds were awfully uncomfortable though. For the duration of your stay in the hotel your sheets will not be changed, there were many stains on one bed that needed changing but they were still there when we left; overall the room was pretty dirty, and the bathroom smelt of sewage. The food was okay, and the restaurant was nicely decorated, they served us mostly prossesed food.',\n",

The beds smelled like piss and the bathroom was the colour of piss. It had no towels or soap and the shower took quarter an hour to warm up. One of the waiters swore at me when I came down to breakfast five minutes too early, which was a big choice of cornflakes or bread with jam. The dinner was also a disappointment. Watery soup for the starter, a strange surprise for the main course and a cheap ice lolly for dessert. The punk like waiter spilt some of the soup on me and he pretended not to notice.

Driver asked if i wanted central ameterdam hotel or airport. When I replied airport he directed me to another stand. All good. At that stand another Best Western Minibus where it was confirmed airport best western.,travelled to hotel and it was wrong hotel. Turns out that Best Western is different from Best Western Plus. I do not think it is reasonable for a new customer to be aware of this. We had to go on return shuttle to airporrt and hunt down another place to get correct shuttle.

The room is lovely with a wooden floor, white linnen and dark yellow curtains. My partner loved the bed, for me it was a bit too soft, but that is a very personal opinion. ,Shower is in the bath and the bath is quite high which might be dangerous for older people.,We did not have dinner in the hotel, so cannot judge the food. ,Breakfast was great, with champagne.

       " ('The hotel is perfectly located within the bustling city of Scheveningen, very close to one of the prettiest and most famous beach resorts in the Netherlands and the well known Circus Theater where you can visit several musicals, like the famous Lion King and other shows. According to Bilderberg you’re at Scheveningen Beach in exactly 198 steps. I didn’t count the steps myself but I was at the beach in no time, facing the iconic renovated Pier that stands several meters above the sea. Bilderberg Europa Hotel is also close to the Hague and other highlights of the area like Madurodam, Museum ‘beelden aan zee’, the famous Muzee Scheveningen, the Lighthouse, Sea Life and Crazy Pianos. ,Bilderberg Europa Hotel offers 174 comfortable rooms with several room categories and views of the village and/or the sea. I was given a recently renovated modern Deluxe Room with a king-size bed, bathroom with walk-in shower, a small working place, huge 40-inch flat screen TV, free Wi-Fi and a small balcony with pretty views of Scheveningen village and the dunes in the distance. You can also opt for sea-view rooms. When entering the room there was a small gift waiting for me: a written welcome message and some chocolate bonbons. It obviously made me smile and I couldn’t resist the bonbons! Although the room and bathroom was a bit small, I loved the modern look of the clean newly renovated room and the comfortable mattress in the king-size bed made me sleep like a baby. I also enjoyed the hot rain shower. ,If you like some more space I would suggest the superior or executive room or one of their huge suites but they are more expensive. The Deluxe room offered everything I needed for a few days Scheveningen and because of the good value for money I would choose that type of room again in the future.,the SALT bar and restaurant has a nice, modern and cosy look. Usually I always go out for drinks and dinner, but because of the look and feel of the SALT Coastal bistro and bar, with nice comfy seats and a gas fireplace I stayed for a drink at the bar. I went out for dinner but if I had an extra night I would definitely make a reservation in their new restaurant SALT. It has a nice atmosphere and gives you the possibility to order all starters and main dishes as tastings or to share. I always love to share! The buffet breakfast was pretty good, with a huge selection of juices, (bio) bread, eggs, (fair trade) fish, meat, cheese, yoghurt, American pancakes and so on. Coffee and tea will be served at your table. Breakfast is served from 7.00 am till 10.30 am and in weekends even till 11.00 am, which is perfect for me since I love to sleep a little longer. ,They have a private secured parking lot for 21,50 euro per day in the basement of the hotel. The hotel also offers 2 electricity points to charge electric cars. Although I think it’s a great facility it’s a lot of money to park your car for a day. In my opinion they should reduce the price for hotel guests. Paying around 20 euro is a normal tariff to park your car in Scheveningen, but if you already spend a lot of money on a room it’s great service to offer guests a parking space at a reduced tariff. Just something for Bilderberg to think about.,After a day exploring the beauty of Scheveningen and its surroundings you are able to relax in their sauna, steam cabin or in the pool. The wellness area is located in the basement of Bilderberg Europa Hotel and is free accessible for hotel guests. I sadly didn’t have time to use the pool or sauna, but I took the elevator down to have a quick look. The area looked reasonable and some hotel guests with kids were enjoying the pool. The fitness area looked a bit dark and could use an upgrade to give it the modern look that fits their renovated rooms and the reception- and restaurant area. If you step into their elevator you don’t need 198 steps to the beach, because it feels like you’re already on the beach enjoying the North Sea.,Since the Netherlands is a famous biking country; I like the bike rental service of Bilderberg Europa Hotel. It’s only 15 euros per day and it’s good fun to explore Scheveningen by bike. The area is quiet flat, so I would definitely recommend renting a bike to enjoy Scheveningen and The Hague at your own pace.,A big plus to this hotel (and all other Bilderberg hotels) is their golden Green Key certification. It’s one of the largest eco-labels for the hospitality industry worldwide and aims to contribute to the prevention of climate change by awarding and advocating facilities with positive environmental initiatives. That means Bilderberg Europa Hotel is environmentally conscious and they invest in facilities that make them more environmentally friendly. They try to keep the CO2 emissions as low as possible and they use pure and honest products with a sustainability label, like BIO, EKO and Fair Trade.,For both business and leisure travellers, this hotel has everything you need. The service was good and the staff very friendly. The receptionist also offered us free entrance tickets for Holland Casino, only a few minutes from the hotel.',\n",

Since we would be arriving late I made a phone call to the hotel, informing them of our late (11 PM) arrival, to make sure that we would have a room. They acknowledged our booking, confirmed the advance payment, and assured me that the room will be available. That same evening we arrive at 10:30 and they tell us that they are over-booked. I simply cannot believe that that did not know this when I called in the morning of the dame day. They then offered us another “also 4 star” hotel in the city. We accepted this offer, since we had no choice. When arriving at this alternative hotel we quickly came to the conclusion that whilst it might be a 4 star on paper, in reality it wasn’t much more than a student dormer. We therefore demanded to get rebooked to the Park Plaza hotel opposite to the railway station.,So we got two lies on one day: a firm confirmation that the room would be available to us; and the suggestion that the alternative hotel was of the same quality.,Rather than avoiding issues for us they chose to let us come there at 11 PM, to then move around the city for another one and a half hour before we finally arrived at an acceptable place to stay.

When I arrived in my room, it reeked of stale smoke so I asked to be moved. I was told there were no other non-smoking rooms available so I was offered an upgrade to an executive room instead. They clearly don't segregate smoking and non-smoking areas as later on that evening, my room smelt of smoke from the nearby smoking rooms. I guess it was coming through the air-conditioning system. The room was fine - the only difference I could see with an executive room was that you got a CD player and some leather tub chairs. The food in the restaurant was pretty dire - I had penne pasta caprese which was basically over-boiled pasta that hadn't been drained properly, with some mozzarella chucked on top and a few measly pieces of tomato and basil. Surprisingly, the restaurant was busy although I can't think why (but, as the other reviewer says, you're in the middle of a business park so where are you going to go?!). ,In terms of getting in and out of Rotterdam, the nearest metro station is only a short walk away, through the middle of the business park. The city centre is five stops away and is very quick (10 mins at most). It's also very cheap. A taxi costs about 15 euros from Centraal station to the Novotel. On the positive side, the staff were very nice and were happy to look after my luggage once I'd checked out. I didn't bother with breakfast (going on the dinner, I wasn't prepared to spend 16 euros on a poor breakfast), so instead I took the metro into the city and found a good place for bagels and coffee.\",\n",

After a hour I went looking for the bottle of wine we ordered and our starter, I found a young girl in the bar area and told her we ordered a bottle of wine she finally brought out a bottle of wine and no glass's to drink from instead of just the bottle and walked away.

As the hotel faces out to an area where buses pick-up I was concerned about noise. While I requested and received a quiet room at the back, the noise in any area of the hotel was never bad. The only downside is that getting to the somewhat limited Haarlem night life/restaurants is a decent walk.

There is a bus running once every hour, or grab a taxi at a a cost of about 20 euros. On the other hand, if you have a car it's great as the hotel is very near the A1 motorway and there is plenty of parking.,There is nothing to do in Hoevelaken itself really, and everything closes early. By 9pm on a Sunday it's completely dead - so if peace and quiet is what you are looking for this is the place.,The hotel itself has quite a high standard, easy to navigate round and it's only two stories high. A downside to this is that many of the rooms are on ground level and face the car park. There is hardly any noise from the car park but if you open the glass door someone could easily sneak in to your room. There is luckily a window you can open instead, to get some air.,The rooms themselves are of average size, a double has a separate bathroom, double bed, desk, TV, cupboards and a small table and two chairs. The bathroom are nice and clean and practical rather than luxurious. The rooms have *no* aircon so it probably gets really hot in the summer. The TV offers 11 channels and an additional 4 pay TV channels. The 11 channels are all Dutch, but where they screen English-language channels they will be subtitled. ,There is also a minibar in the rooms with all the usual items. Roomservice is fast and you can even get lighter snacks 24 hours a day. The main menu finishes at 11pm and the food is great - I had a lovely tomato soup followed by poached salmon on a bed of noodles with cheesecake for dessert. It's not cheap though and the hotel charges an extra 7 euros for each roomservice order.,Breakfast is served in a lovely restaraunt filled with Dutch farming memorabilia and glass/porcelain. There is eggs, bacon and sausages, a variety of fresh bread, ham, cheese, youghurt, cerals and juices. ,Service is friendly and helpful (albeit a bit slow). There is also a gym with a jacuzzi and steam room but I have not tried these.\",\n",

We had to catch a flight connection the next morning from Amsterdam to Aruba and decided spend the night near the airport. We chose this hotel as it was pretty new and they had a shuttle service to the airport. The day of arrival we waited for about 45 min at the airport around 8.00 PM for the shuttle. It just did not arrive and we were \"forced\" to take a taxi (20 eur) to get to the hotel. That was all right. No problem. Things can happen. We spent the night in a family room (simple, basic, but not that bad!) and the next morning we got to the reception, asking for our shuttle service. We got there at about 10.10 AM in the morning and they said we have 20 min to wait as the shuttle left every 30 min (at 10.00, 10.30, 11.00 and so on). At 10.30 the shuttle didn\\'t arrive. The receptionists (two young girls) said it should be there in few moments. At 10.35, they tried to call the shuttle driver, without any success. Under my pressure, they asked to their supervisor (a young men), what was going on. The manager said me I have two choice: (1) he could call a taxy for us and pay for it; (2) wait 20 - 25 min more to wait for the shuttle of 11.00 o\\'clock. We were delaying and risking to lose our intercontinental flight and we opted for the first solution. Yet, the taxi didn\\'t arrive. We kept on put the attendant under pressure to know the reason why in Amsterdam a taxi takes so long to arrive. The taxi didn\\'t arrive at all and at about 11.00 o\\'clock the shuttle appeared. The attendant lied. He didn\\'t call the taxi to save 20 Eur. But, he was a liar and he didn\\'t save his face to us.

We had to wait 20 minutes until they could assign us a second room. Room was very small with a kitchenette in one corner. Shower room was very simple without even a shower tray to stand on.  Water drained through a hole on the floor.  There is no air conditioning and the room was very hot and stuffy. Some rooms overlook the railway so if you want fresh air you will have to listen to trains passing by. However, that was not the worst part. The soap dispenser in the toilet dispensed not soap but some dirty black liquid! Even after having asked for soap a couple of times, we did not get any. There is also no hotel toiletry provided. So if you happen to be staying only for 1 night on business and did not bring your own, you are in trouble. The IKEA bed did not have a headboard and the sheets were torn and holed in a few places. The room was so cramped that in order to get into the bed you had to climb in from its foot.

Well after staying here I would do it again. I debated about the location since it was about 20 minutes out of the center of things. But this was a blessing. It makes getting to your hotel much easier from the airport. TIP: you will not have to go through all the stops to get to your hotel if you choose this location which means you will not be crammed in if its busy with your luggage. Just 3 stops on the metro or tram (51 & 5) after getting off the train from Schiphols. Staff are some of the best we have had (even better than the Marriott in Boston where rooms are over $300). Check in was quick. Room is spotless and comfortable. TV has quite a few channels and covers some English channels. The bathroom has a step in shower with good pressure and heat. All in one toiletries. If you need anything you can go to reception and pick up things you might have forgot. Breakfast Is very nice and I always appreciate anything over just coffee. The re is a nice sitting area and I can see during high season this room getting full fast. A nice selection of European deli, cheese, yogurt, pastries and cereal. There is also a selection of Kosher items. More than enough to get you through the day. Try the chocolate croissants in the kosher section. Coffee and espresso machine will make a choice of drinks but I found that they all tasted similar. The location is perfect. It is in a quiet neighborhood. There is an Asian café next door and behind it is a row of shops. THese shops are fun to walk through and checkout...pastry shop, flowers, deli, café, and I think a seafood stall. There is a \"jumbo\" grocery store if you need anything more. ,I would not think of going anywhere else. If you are young and want to be in the middle of it all there are lots of other choice. For us this was ideal. TIP: get a multiday pass. We used that thing so many times. and do not forget to check in and out with the cards (you will see little stands where you hold the card and hear it beep). Getting from Schiphols is easy...just one stop Zuid and then take metro or tram.

You wouldn't think it could be so bad.,First of all, I have to comment on the decor.  This is a NEW hotel.  It has only recently opened.  The decor is just awful - the designer must be the owners wife and he's too scared to say anything.  It's like something from post war germany.  Awful.  It looks like it has been open for twenty years and never been refurbished.,However, that shouldn't be too much of an issue for an overnight stop.  The first real problem was, however, that because the hotel has all been done cheaply, the curtains are not black out curtains.  Thus the sign on the building opposite shone into my room all night, making it light enough to read by, even with the curtains closed.,The other light problem in the room is the tv (it's a modern lcd tv, which looks as out of place in this room as it would in your grandmothers lounge room).  The tv has a clock on it that shines at a brightness that, again, is bright enough to read by.  If you need darkness then I suggest you do as I did - prop the minibar menu up in front of the tv before attempting to sleep.,If these things don;t keep you awake, then the mini-bar fridge will.  Mine woke me up three times, with a loud vibrating noise that only stopped when I got out of bed and hit the fridge hard on the top.,If this doesn;t wake you up, then the rattling pipes and sound of running water from the plumbing will.  ,And if none of this is bad enough, when I arrived there were drunks in reception - having overfllowed from the bar - and the minibus from schiphol doesn;t keep to the schedule.  When it arrived to collect us (ten minutes later than advertised) we filled the bus up, and the driver then said it would be 8 minutes before he would leave, as he needed a cigarette.  Very precise, but not good service.,Oh, and if you ask for a non-smoking room, even if you remember to remind them of this when you check in, they will ignore you.  I requested non-smoikng when reserving and when checking in.  I get to the room and it's a smoker.  just useless.,This hotel is truly horrible.  Everything about it is dreary, dull and ugly.

Lord help the others.,*could have been a little cheaper for what was given,*no free in room coffee maker,*nothing to put your suitcase on. chair was plastic and narrow so didn't use it,I fly standby a lot so this worked for me and I would probably stay here again in a pinch but not if there are other options.

They are also very helpful with any recommendations in the area. ,The lobby was very nice and had free Nespresso coffee for guests as a table to sit at. The hotel also has a nice gym with new equipment. Everywhere in the hotel was spotlessly clean. ,Finally the room (a studio) had everything you would need for a long or medium stay. A stove top, oven, fridge and dishwasher. The beds were very comfortable and both the bedroom and living room area had TV's. Would definitely stay here whenever I am in Rotterdam.\",\n",

At checkin you have the option of buying the next mornings breakfast - doing so gives you a good breakfast at a reasonable price - if you don't you can have the same stuff a la carte but pay more.,The room is meant for a short stay - no cupboards, no drawers you live out of your suit case for the time you are there.  The room price is fairly low - say compared to the Sheraton a hundred meters closer to the terminal.,The bed is huge, the room is noise free.

There are plenty of vending machines offering snacks and drinks in reception.  Free WiFi is available.,Our only suggestion is that we stayed in the Ibis Budget Geneva a few days later and they had a shower gel dispenser in the shower which is much less wasteful than the bars of soap in the room.

Double blackout blinds to the windows (nice touch) meant you were not woken up early by daylight streaming through at 6am in the morning. Pillows good.,Average points - bar, reception and general area's all pretty standard for a hotel chain but still nice/good quality but nothing special. Breakfast standard fair for hotel chain - has a latte/cappuccino machine ,Slight pain point - perhaps the biggest thing hotels overlook is the power of the bedroom shower water pressure. Its my key annoyance. With that said The Hyatt Place bedroom showers were OK (I've had far worse) but just wished for a little more to wake me from my morning daze please.,Some points: Free shuttle service to and from airport and hotel - 10 minutes transfer - goes every 30 mins - Go to Arrival Hall 4 - Follow the signs “STA desk” to Arrival Hall 4, where you will find the agent transfer room/desk situated across the Starbucks and next to the AKO bookstore. Not that straightforward to find but it is literally right next to a side entrance (not main).
