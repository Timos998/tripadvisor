But the IBIS bus keeps going until about 0130 am, and then starts up again only a couple of hours later in the morning.  One drawback, though:  This hotel doesn't offer luggage storage, so if you're checking out in the morgning but leaving Amsterdam later in the day, you either have to check in your bags at the Central Station in Amsterdam, - or do an early check-in at the Schiphol airport, without necessarily going through security though.,I will definitely stay at this hotel again, though I would naturally prefer to stay more centrally in Amsterdam, if rooms were available at a more reasonable rate than is normal in that city.\",\n",

The ride takes about 8 minutes.,The train from the airport to central Amsterdam for day trips, cost\\'s around EU$3.60 one way or EU$6.20 return and takes about 20 minutes.,Good business hotel with well equipped rooms. Mine had a view which encapsulated a bridge over a canal, a road (which goes very quiet at night), and a large commercial building.,VERY comfortable bed, luxurious pillows and linen. Fully equipped bathroom, with shower and bath. The safe operates on the swipe of any credit card, but I couldn\\'t get it to work properly, so didn\\'t bother with it.,A well stocked mini bar at the usual inflated prices. Beware that each product has a sensor beneath that automatically bills the removed product to your room account after 10 seconds. So taking stuff out to make space for that 6 pack of beer you bought elsewhere will need an explanation at check-out.,Plenty of TV stations in most common languages of the world to entertain you. The large window offered only a small opening, which at least allowed some ventilation of any unusual fumes from the room (The Hotel is silent on the issue of cannabis consumption in the rooms). All smoking rooms are located on the 2nd floor of the 6 or 7 story hotel.,The Sports/Media Bar downstairs is a cool place to chill, even having live bands/DJ, and reasonably priced beers.,Breakfast was about what you\\'d expect from this class of hotel, with a chef on hand to whip you up some eggs or whatever.,Overall I found the hotel was a comfortable and well positioned last day option before catching an early flight out from schiphol the next day.,Fairly priced when booked through Asiarooms.com, this was the best bargain in Holland, even considering travelling time to Amsterdam Central.',\n",

It's a nice location - by a lake, nice view and pretty quiet.  Some staff were helpful, some not so much. Our eldest had an ear infection and the receptionist found a doctor, arranged an appointment and gave us directions. Couldn't ask for more. The receptionist working the next day was surly and aloof, so a bit of pot luck regarding the helpfulness of staff. ,On the down side, well, if you go for a quiet hotel it is likely to be out of the way. This was no exception (this might give you an idea: the goats on the other side on the lake woke me up a few times one night!), which is why the extra fee for parking seems so unreasonable. It's not in the middle of town, and even when there was a conference held at the hotel, there were still plenty of spaces. So why should paying guests have to pay for parking in the middle of nowhere? The receptionist told me I could leave my car outside the car park but it might not be so safe. Gee thanks. ,Bit of a story about the minibar: Upon arrival, one of my boys opened the minibar and took out a can. We tried to put it back but each time you pull open the minibar another can pops out and you are charged for it. It looked like we were going to be charged for three cans, but upon leaving I told the receptionist that we left the cans on top of the bar as we didn't intend to take anything and she deducted it from my bill. Can't say fairer than that.,Finally, if you're with kids, the bowling is a big plus and they do a great snack platter there. The area is also great for walks, but I would recommend hiring a car. (We hired with the Avis at Utrecht station - although it was a bit of a walk with two small kids to the Avis office).    ,All in all, a good place to stay.\",\n",

       " (\"I stayed at  the 'des Indes' recently whilst on business. The first impressions were excellent. Firstly the hotel is in the centre of the Hague's 'old town' which is a very pleasant place to spend the evening. It is also in a large but old building and has clearly recently re-opened after total refurbishment. ,The reception has that 'grandeur' associated with two receptionists siting behind a wonderful antique table rather than some impersonal reception area. This helps build strong first impressions.,These are not let down by the rooms which are not oversized but very comfortable with a large and very comfortable bed and a bathroom that has high quality fittings (in general). Very similar style to the (highly recommended) College Hotel in Amsterdam. If you have a thing about high ceilings - be warned they are miles above your head.,My only concern about my room (and it should be yours also) is that it was on the ground floor and right next door to the main entrance of the hotel. I was very surprised that the Meridian ever decided to put any rooms on the ground floor of an 'inner city' Hotel that was so close to 'traffic' both of the vehicular and human variety. I enquired as to whether they thought this room might be rather noisy and was told that on a Saturday it could be a problem but on a Thursday night I should be fine.,Having had a very good dinner at the local italian restaurant (Casa Contini - I think it was called - go down side street by the 'Juliene' (much more formal) restaurant and it is on the left. Great host, fine wine and full of lively dutch all having a good time) - I went back to my hotel room having fully taken on board the heavily increased noise levels from the adjacent street with all its restaurants and bars. My fears of a sleepless night escalated when back in my room three teenagers seemed to camp on their bicycles right outside my window. After half an hour of high pitched laughing I decided a room change was advisable. ,At this point the hotel staff could not have been more helpful and I was duly shown to an available room on the 2nd floor right opposite the 'Juliene' restaurant on 'Party' street. Well ....it was even noisier ... so finally ended up back next to the front door. BIG mistake .... finally lost my cool with a very drunk mid 40s lady at 04.00 in the morning who was telling wild and loud stories for 30 mins on the front steps of the hotel. She was the last of a number of similar groups that formed through the night. ,So bottom line... I will definitely go back to the hotel which above all has some very friendly staff and is comfortable. The public areas maybe a little dark and 'too red' for some tastes - its all sort of a modern take on smart vistorian - but I will be very careful which room I choose. Aim high up and don't be on the right hand side of the hotel  which looks down on main drag.,Only complaint otherwise was a mirror light in my bathroom which I could not switch off !

They clearly don't segregate smoking and non-smoking areas as later on that evening, my room smelt of smoke from the nearby smoking rooms. I guess it was coming through the air-conditioning system. The room was fine - the only difference I could see with an executive room was that you got a CD player and some leather tub chairs. The food in the restaurant was pretty dire - I had penne pasta caprese which was basically over-boiled pasta that hadn't been drained properly, with some mozzarella chucked on top and a few measly pieces of tomato and basil.

       " ('We attempted to book into the Hotel de Doelen in Leiden, and were referred to the Nieuw Minerva. At first glance, the hotel appeared quite worn and the steep stairs daunting, but we decided to give it a try for at least one night. This turned out to be a smart choice. As we became familiar with the area, the Nieuw Minerva was likely equal to the other hotels  in the historic Leiden center city area. The 2 star rating for Nieuw Minerva is accurate and fair. Here are a few of its strengths and also some suggestions for improvement. ,Strengths: The staff was very helpful and spoke perfect English as well as a number of other languages. Breakfast offered several cold plate options in addition to warm boiled eggs and toast (one side of the toaster is broken). The luxury rooms on a whole were comparatively large by European standards, but they could not be called spacious. The facility was generally well maintained considering it is several hundred years old. Canal facing rooms offer a charming view. The lobby bar area is adequate and prices are reasonable. ,Areas needing attention: Directions to the hotel need to be detailed from both the Leiden train station and from Schiphol airport. The directions provided at the Hotel De Doelen Web site could be used as an example. Due to the number of one way streets, directions to the Nieuw Minerva should cover both walking and driving approaches. (This is one tough place to find by automobile.) If you reserve a luxury room, it should include baggage placement in room (most guests would willingly pay extra once the stairs are seen). The stairs are narrow and steep and would be impossible for anyone with balance difficulties. The Leiden Medical and Science Museum is also an historic building and offers electric stair lifts without affecting the historic integrity of the property. Only a very few luxury rooms resemble the quality shown on the Web site. Our room (#14) was better than most in the hotel (photos attached).  We visited luxury room #7 on the alley side and it was smaller with different décor. Standard rooms are much smaller and spartan. Directions for the in-room TV operation need to be posted (especially during World Cup season). The TV remote control and manual operation defy logic. Bathrooms need grout work and scrubbing to remove mildew between tiles. The building has no air conditioning (nor do most buildings in the center city) and small portable AC window units would be a blessing during rare heat waves (as we encountered). WiFi Internet access should be installed.  The “community access” computer in the lobby area often malfunctions, is set up for Dutch language, and is often unavailable when in use by staff or other guests.  The noise level on both the canal side and alley is unbearable with the windows open. The hotel is near the university and on all but 1 of our 7 nights  in the hotel, students partied nightly until dawn. The hotel staff should be alert to this, especially on hot nights when all guest room windows are open. \"Quiet please!\" signage might be helpful. ,This may seem like a tough review, but the items mentioned would help a great deal.  Due to the Nieuw Minerva location, kind staff, and the building itself,  there is potential to make this property the leading hotel in the center city.  We believe the De Doelen and Mayflower hotels would offer little improvement. The Mayflower is located on a major square surrounded by late night cafes. It would be difficult to park a car nearby and the noise level may be much worse. The Holiday Inn(s) and Golden Tulip are located a distance from the historic city and would require a considerable hike to see the city sights.',\n",

The hotel is wonderful and I recommend it to you.,Getting from the airport to the hotel is fast and easy, thanks to an enclosed walkway that features moving sidewalks.  The check-in process was fast and painless, and less than 30 minutes after walking off the plane I was in my room on the 11th floor.  The design of this Hilton is unusual in that it features an atrium.  I had a corner room with views of the airport.,There is a lounge located on the 10th floor that can be accessed by elevator or stairs.  Access is based either on your room rate (e.g., executive level rooms) or your status within the Hilton HHonors program (e.g., Diamond tier status).,The room itself was spacious and well laid-out, and the finish and furnishings were tasteful.  The room features a large flat-panel TV, a mini-bar, both an easy chair and a small sofa, and a coffee/tea set-up.  I particularly liked the desk set-up, which had good lighting and plenty of power outlets.  Wifi connectivity was very good with excellent download speeds.,The bathroom was one of the largest I've seen in a Hilton located in Europe.  Aside from being spotlessly clean, the bathroom provides a large vanity area around the sink, and both an enclosed shower and a separate tub.  Guests will find robes and slippers and a nice assortment of toiletries.,I was able to enjoy a good night's sleep.  The construction of the building allows no noise in from the nearby airport.  The king bed was very comfortable and the bedding (a duvet) was spotless.,The hotel is not inexpensive, but I feel that I received good value given the hotel's proximity to the airport and the overall quality of the hotel.  I was very impressed by this Hilton property, and I recommend it to you.\",\n",

       " ('The reason I\\'m giving this place a poor instead of a terrible is that at least our room \"Royal Suite\" was beautiful and it had a power shower. But we were not given the \"royal\" treatment for what we were paying. This place is being run as the owners personal playground. She has her friends over who don\\'t stay here but use the wine cellar below us to party all night long. Our sleep was already disturbed by the noise below us and above us as there is no insulation between levels but then the taxi came at 5am to pick up the revellers, waking us up again by pounding on the door. We got very little sleep the two nights we were here. The worse thing to happen though was that our car got towed out in front of the B&B. We made sure there was parking before we arrived and how much it was in messages with the B&B. Nothing was ever told to us about Saturday Market days that you can\\'t park in certain areas, not even when we checked in (we arrived on a Friday), which is when you would think someone would have mentioned that very important fact. One of these tow zone areas was out in front (the closest to their front door). This is where we parked. We don\\'t read Dutch so didn\\'t notice the sign that stated you can\\'t park there between 00:00 - 18:00 on Saturdays. We awoke on Saturday, which was supposed to be a day of celebrating as it was my birthday, to a missing car. The car was tracked down and the towing company wanted an extortionate amount to release it - €257.50! The owner offered us a free taxi ride as compensation knowing that they were at fault for not warning us. I wasn\\'t happy with this and told her that I also expected half of our stay back. She agreed to refund one night\\'s stay as well. We were still out of pocket and not happy with the damper that it placed on the day. As a result, the inconvenience of a late start and having to find alternative parking had a trickle down effect and affected all of our plans. We never ended up getting a cake for my birthday and we missed out on our dinner reservations and ended up eating somewhere else less disirable. She knew it was my birthday and I kept hoping every time we came back to our room that we\\'d find she did something to make up for this happening during our stay by providing a free bottle of wine or champagne knowing she had a whole wine cellar of wine and a fridge filled with chilled wine upstairs. She didn\\'t do anything but instead had a loud party with her friends, disturbing all of her occupants. I would never recommend this place. I think the owner needs to grow up and start taking her business responsibilities seriously. There is a sign she has hung up on the wall that states \\'People will forget what you said, People will forget what you did, But people will never forget how you made them feel.\\' She needs to let this message sink in because she made us feel like we were nothing but a room sale for her. Breakfast was also a disappointment. I had heard such great things about the breakfasts but they consisted of stale bread and cheese and very skimpy on the sliced meat. The soft boiled egg was almost hardboiled. There was no love put into any of it. She also expected us to eat pouring yogurt over oatmeal.  Very odd. She dumped the contents of one fruit bowl that was leftover by another guests and combined it with ours on the table. She did this right in front of us and apparently thought nothing of it. That\\'s a bit unsanitary as we don\\'t know what that the other couple had done with theirs. Breakfast is not worth the €10pp. In fact, I\\'d go someplace else for breakfast. It\\'s not really a B&B is it, if they charge for breakfast? Also, some of the amenities were lacking; there was no bin in the room so we left all of our trash on the glass desk to be cleaned up. There were also no tissues so had to use toilet paper. Slippers were provided but no robe. We got one towel each to use, which is stingy - not luxury. Upon check out - the owner was MIA. Probably in bed with a hangover. You would have thought that she would care how our day turned out after retrieving our car but no, she chose to avoid us instead. No one was found in fact when we wanted to check out so had no other choice but to leave the room key in the room so we could get on the road. Best to avoid this one.',\n",

You wouldn't think it could be so bad.,First of all, I have to comment on the decor.  This is a NEW hotel.  It has only recently opened.  The decor is just awful - the designer must be the owners wife and he's too scared to say anything.  It's like something from post war germany.  Awful.  It looks like it has been open for twenty years and never been refurbished.,However, that shouldn't be too much of an issue for an overnight stop.  The first real problem was, however, that because the hotel has all been done cheaply, the curtains are not black out curtains.  Thus the sign on the building opposite shone into my room all night, making it light enough to read by, even with the curtains closed.,The other light problem in the room is the tv (it's a modern lcd tv, which looks as out of place in this room as it would in your grandmothers lounge room).  The tv has a clock on it that shines at a brightness that, again, is bright enough to read by.  If you need darkness then I suggest you do as I did - prop the minibar menu up in front of the tv before attempting to sleep.,If these things don;t keep you awake, then the mini-bar fridge will.  Mine woke me up three times, with a loud vibrating noise that only stopped when I got out of bed and hit the fridge hard on the top.,If this doesn;t wake you up, then the rattling pipes and sound of running water from the plumbing will.  ,And if none of this is bad enough, when I arrived there were drunks in reception - having overfllowed from the bar - and the minibus from schiphol doesn;t keep to the schedule.  When it arrived to collect us (ten minutes later than advertised) we filled the bus up, and the driver then said it would be 8 minutes before he would leave, as he needed a cigarette.  Very precise, but not good service.,Oh, and if you ask for a non-smoking room, even if you remember to remind them of this when you check in, they will ignore you.  I requested non-smoikng when reserving and when checking in.  I get to the room and it's a smoker.  just useless.,This hotel is truly horrible.  Everything about it is dreary, dull and ugly.  It seems to have been built on the cheap and furnished on the cheap.  How it gets four stars is beyond me.,Stay at the NH over the road.  Stay at the Ibis.

The code was entered and the lock was determined by us to be safe and so we put our passports, children\\'s birth documents, 2 IPads, my phone and an envelope containing $1380 Canadian dollars into the safe.,The next day (July 9th) we verified the safe was locked before heading out for our first day in Central Amsterdam.  We left the hotel around 10am after breakfast and headed to the train station.,Upon our return to the hotel room at 6:30pm we noticed after opening up the cabinet where the safe and refrigerator where that the safe was open and the passcode RESET.,We immediately went through all our belonging in the safe and where shocked to find that the CASH in the envelope was gone. All other items were still in the safe. Only the untraceable cash was removed and the envelope left behind.,We reported this to hotel management who came investigate the room.,They insured us that they would look into the matter but had to wait until tomorrow as the cleaning staff was gone for the day.,Hotel Management pulled data from the hotel room door to see who had entered and later came to pull data from the safe.,That evening the 2 police officer came to our room while my children were present to investigate the room and look at the safe and take a preliminary report.,The next day (July 10) my family stayed in the hotel room for the majority of the day waiting for an update from the hotel as they completed their investigation into the stolen money.,We did not request cleaning service from that point on as we no longer felt safe or trusted anyone, especially the cleaning staff at the hotel. ,In the evening after several requests for updates the hotel provided me an explanation that the investigation gave them inconclusive result as questioning the cleaning staff and pulling the data from the room and safe could not provide them adequate information to prove money was stolen from our room. ,With no money, I asked the hotel to pay for a Taxi so that I could report this to the police. After refusing to do so, I made a scene, by raising my voice in the lobby and was able to speak to the director of marketing & sales who arranged for a Taxi. ,That evening I went to the local Police and filed a police report.,On July 11th the day of our checkout, I still had not received an adequate response from the hotel as to how money was stolen from a locked safe that they provided and only they had access to rest. As such as requested to not pay for the hotel stay as we did not receive the safety, comfort or hospitality that the Renaissance claimed to provide. After the first day our trip was ruined, all our money to enjoy the country stolen and we were traumatized, depressed and fearful the remainder of the stay. We did not even have our room cleaned the last 2 days.,I suggested that as the investigation was still ongoing that the hotel should not have us pay for our stay here as it was far from adequate and was in fact a \"nightmare\". ,Management refused and said there was nothing they could do an in fact the room had already been charged upon check in. ,In addition, during this time my daughter feel of the bed in her room and the hotel was not even equipped with an ice pack, and when was requested by my wife they brought us a beer glass filled with ice, another example of the inadequate care for or safety while in their care.,We left the hotel and Amsterdam in general with such a sour taste in our mouths.,As we were leaving we also were almost denied access onto the shuttle bus because our stroller wouldn\\'t fit in the back of the bus as many people were leaving for the airport at the same time. Again I had to raise my voice and express my disappointment with the hotel before we were allowed to board the shuttle bus.,When we returned home to Canada I received an email message from the general manager of the hotel saying that the investigation had now conclusively determined that the safe was open. Like that was some type of justification for the money being stolen form the safe. Locked or not (we still maintain it was locked) how does that give the staff permission to take our things. In that case should be have locked up our toothbrushes, clothes, children\\'s stuffed animals? Is nothing safe in the Renaissance Hotel? ,The hotel will not provide me with the information pulled from the safe indicating it was UNLOCKED and has said they will provide it to the police if asked. My suspicion is that this data does not exist. If it did why not show it to me. Prove to me that we did not lock it and therefore we are at fault for leaving money in our locked hotel room that only cleaning staff had access to.,At the moment I have still disputing with the Renaissance Hotel and the Marriot head office consumer affairs to see what type of compensation I can receive for this horrible and utterly despicable situation. ,Beyond monetary loss my children were exposed to police officer in the room in the middle of the night and seeing their parent in a state of shock, fear and vulnerability.

This hotel was the last stop on the 2nd August before I would get a flight home and my husband and friend would catch the ferry home as they were on motorbikes.,Up on arrival I paid for the room in full on my pre paid travel money card which was €253 then the receptionist asked for €180 (€60 each) as a deposit for incidentals!? I questioned it as it was a large deposit to leave but I did leave this in cash. ,Later than evening I checked my balance on my card and realised that €253 had been taken and a further €253 frozen on my card. So not only had I paid upfront for the room they had taken a further €180 cash deposit and now a further €253 how much money does this hotel want off me?,That night I went and questioned the receptionist and he told me that I was to speak to some one in the morning as they would speak with the accounts department. ,In the morning I checked out and spoke to the receptionist on duty that morning, she had not got a clue as to why the money was frozen other than it being for incidentals even though I had left €180 cash. She assured me that I would get this back on my card after check out.,After a good hour and no refunded money i was running out of time to book my flight home. I asked another receptionist on duty who just pointed me in the direction of the phone for customer services, so yet again not one of your members of staff took responsibility for this situation.,The €253 was partly for my flight home which incidentally I could not take so had to travel for a further 20 hours via the ferry (as it was the cheaper option) from Dunkirk as the ferry at hook v Holland was booked for two days because of the issues with Calais. ,That money should have never been frozen on my card! I paid €253 for the room and then a further €433 was then taken off me. ,I've travelled to a lot of places and stayed in many hotels but not one of them had ever frozen money on my card with out telling me other than what is due to be taken out in payment for the room.,It is disgusting that not one of your members of staff took responsibility for this problem. You cases me a lot of stress and agro but on top of that you wasted my time as it took me a hell of a lot longer to travel home. I hope you realise just how cold it is travelling on the back of a bike from Dover to the midlands through the night to get home. ,I'm still angry at your hotel that you put me in a predicament like that and needless to say I will never use your hotels again. \",\n",

       " (\"My travel agent booked us for NH Schiphol at the last minute when we were already having difficulty booking our choice hotels in the central part of Amsterdam.  I read the reviews and it was clear that there will be no problems with the rooms only with the location. I have found tripadvisor reviews to be oftentimes if not always accurate and true enough the rooms were great. It had a modern style, clean, well-equipped and looked fresh and new. Bathroom amenities were ample and included many extras like two kinds of sponges, a comb and a brush, sewing kit in durable plastic packets. My husband lost his baggage for two days and the housekeeping  staff (thanks Jocelyn and Josie)were very generous and sympathetic  and provided him with socks, bathrobe and dental kit (Itoothbrush,toothpaste). Only complaint was the towels which were quite thin and a bit worn. It's a regret because everything else was perfect!,The beds were comfortable and bigger as compared to other European hotels we have stayed in. It was very quiet, considering it was located within the vicinity of the airport. There was wireless internet connection which costs around 21euros for 24 hours. They also have the 17euros for 24 hours option but on limited download capacity ( I suggest to get the 21 euro package,little difference). There were enough cabinets for storage, personal safe and coffeemaking machine. ,Breakfast was great(Included in our room rate)There's a variety of hot and cold entrees (main staples were bacon, shirred eggs, 6 minute eggs and 11 minute eggs :-) , sausages, baked beans, hash browns, your choice of omelettes upon request.  They have excellent smoked salmon, cold cuts, an assortment of cheeses and spreads, delicious danish pastries, cereals and fresh fruits. Of course, a selection of juices, milk and teas were also included. ,People from the reception were friendly and courteous, concierge were helpful , always smiling and willing to assist.,Locatiion..oh...the location. It's really quite far from the central. Saving grace was they have a free shuttle to and from Schiphol airport (within the airport terminal is also the train and tram terminals )every 20 minutes. Only thing was it can only accomodate 10 persons at a time. Sometimes we had to wait for the next batch (which would take another 20 minutes) because we were a family of five. They have their own spot in the terminal where you can wait for their shuttles. Usually, there's already several persons waiting ahead of us thus we have to wait for the next shuttle which will arrive in another 20 minutes. This made us really tired and we felt we spent so much time travelling to and from the hotel even with the free shuttle service., A BIG TIP: Always ask for the higher floor rooms (ours was 4th level). It was good I read the reviews because I was being given rooms on the 1st floor which were not renovated yet. I did not accpet it and demanded rooms on the higher floors.I checked it out later and found out it was  worn, shabby and stuffy.BIG DIFFERENCE. I guess those guests who gave a bad  review of the hotel stayed in these unrenovated rooms.,NH Schiphol for the rooms and service is a YES.

We were fortunate to switch to a room on the east side of the hotel, but our travel companions were not so lucky.  The hot June sun baked the western rooms, and there was no AC, no available fans, and no way to keep the windows open, yet secure.  The design of the sliding glass doors, the low ceilings, the direction of the rooms all conspired to make for a couple uncomfortable nights.  Worse yet, the maid opened the heavy curtains in the morning to make certain that the hot afternoon sun baked the room once again.

It picks up every 30 minutes at the airport and hotel, and runs from early until late. There was one occasion where seats had been fully reserved all morning for customers who were checking out of the hotel, so we caught the local bus service to the centre instead. It was cheap (€6 for 90 minute bus pass) and easy enough and the hotel provide good information on how to do this. Usually there are some unreserved hotel shuttle seats available and these are on a first come first serve basis. Sometimes you have to wait for the next shuttle if there is high demand which usually seems to be the case between 9-11am. I found some visitors were rude, and people who had been waiting over 30 minutes for the shuttle were barged out the way by people who had arrived just before the shuttle turned up. There is no fair system if people are inconsiderate so it might be worth the hotel thinking up a strategy for making sure people without a priority reservation board the shuttle fairly if there is a wait. The priority reservation when checking out is a great idea.

The room was modern and fit for purpose for an overnight stay, though better suited for the business traveller than the tourist. Breakfast good, the sort over which to hold a meeting. I didn't come away with fond memories of my stay at the Novotel, but then, that wasn't really the purpose of my trip. So it hit the mark for what was needed.

       " ('Probably it’s a too long report of my experience in this hotel, but I hope you can find some help about how to behave, in case you still decide to go.,First of all, I do not know which are the rules (?) to release stars over there in Noordwijk aan Zee, but this is DEFINITELY NOT a 5 stars hotel. To be generous, it could be a 4 stars and certainly it is far from a 5 stars level as far as its desk staff is concerned (this taken alone would deserve 2 stars at most). Instead, there is no doubt that the  prices of the services are at a 5 stars level:  A) Breakfast: if you have not included in your package, it costs more than 22 euro per person, so I suggest you to get your breakfast in one of the cafes 100 metres downhill (it’s around 12-14 euros for two persons) and to conveniently save money for a nicer dinner/lunch in some restaurant. B) Internet: the hotel has wired and wireless connections, but not owned: it’s run independently by Swisscom, so you have two choices. The first is to spend 10 euros for a limited traffic amount: I don’t remember how much (but not much), but be careful because this amount must be used within 24 hours, otherwise you have to pay again (don’t trust the hotel’s employees: they do even know how rates work). The second choice is to use the PC workplace (there is only one workplace, and some unknown genius placed it just beneath the reception desk, so you can imagine the level of privacy you have) connected to a printer and to the internet. Here you pay per time of use: I spent almost five euro for writing a 8 lines e-mail and sending it. C) Parking: costs a lot (more than 20 euros per day: if you park the car about 800 metres far from the hotel, for instance in Rembrandtweg, it’s free…at least in June 2009..).,I reserved through my Expedia internet account a double superior room for 2 persons and 4 nights (from Monday to Friday, therefore not including the weekend, when room rates in Noordwijk are raised to levels comparable to those of Capri in summer). As many you may know, the room reserved in this way has to be paid in advance: rooms had a different cost per day of the week, but in total I paid 567,97 euro plus 29,12 euro visitor tax at the check out, therefore with a daily average of 149.25 euro per day, breakfast NOT included. ,I reached the hotel with other two friends that had other two separate single rooms (not superior de luxe, but “simply” de luxe). The basic “visible” difference was the price, and indeed this was my first surprise, since they paid around 90 euros per night. I visited their rooms and, exception made a couple of square metres less, their rooms were quite similar to mine: they included also a team shower with eucalyptus oil (wow!), like my room.,Before leaving, I had read the description of the superior deluxe room in the hotel website (http://www.palacehotel.nl):  “In all rooms, however, the living and bedroom areas are separated. All our superior deluxe rooms have 2 TVs, of which 1 sits atop a pop-up television cabinet at the foot of the bed. Thus you can enjoy your favourite TV programme from the comfort of your bed just before going to sleep...”. In the case of my room, this was absolutely false: the bedroom and living room were in the same area and there was only 1 TV (actually this was not a problem for me, but this was the real thing). The room was at the street level, and from one window I could see a quite ugly street with the monstuous “Hotel ter Duinen” (who authorized its construction should be arrested) in the background, and from the other window a parking lot, which is not bad at all for a deluxe superior room. From the same website: “Too, all our superior deluxe rooms, with the exception of the corner rooms, are equipped with a shower and a bath. And, of course, 2 washstands…” Obviously I had got a corner room and one washstand only…,The nicest surprise, however, was the telephone: I had 3 (three) telephones in my room, but no one working. I needed a telephone to call a toll free number for telephone calls abroad at reduced rates (I had my pc with me but, as I said, forget the convenience of using skype for tel calls with the rates mentioned above). So I went immediately to the reception desk to complain: the guy at the reception stared at me as if I were a fool, since I was asking to fix a phone problem in a 5 star hotel at 9.00 PM. Obviously, I had to wait next morning. As far as the room was concerned, he checked and said (smiling with all his available teeth) that it definitely was a deluxe superior room and there had been no mistake. Conclusion (mine): there is a mistake (or lie?) in their website. The morning after, I reported the telephone problem to the reception desk again (obviously the brilliant guy of the evening before had left no note) and they said they would have solved. When I came back in the evening, phones were still not working. Back to the reception: no one knows anything and a girl takes a note (where shall they throw all those notes?). The morning after I asked again the clerk at the reception, and she called a lady that seemed to be a staff chief: after I recalled that I had been asking to solve the problem for 2 days, she told me without any sense of shame “we know that there are rooms where there is no way to make telephone work”, and the only thing she could do was to change my room. Avoiding to be too rude, I recalled her that I had to leave the day after and changing the room now wouldn’t have been very comfortable and clever. When I asked why they did not tell me before, she said she was not aware of the problem.,This is just to give you an idea of the level organization in this hotel where the right hand does not know what the left hand is making and viceversa, so you’re warned. ,The most important thing, however, is to ask to be informed what they are doing with your credit card. In fact, two weeks after I had checked out, a payment though my credit card (a mastercard) was rejected because of insufficient credit. Going on my card’s website I found that I had only 140 euro credit instead of the 750 that I should have had, so I called the Mastercard helpdesk and they explained to me that there was a sequence of amounts (one for each day of my stay: 200, 99.80, 99.80, 77.40, 135.60 for a total of 612.6 euro) that had been safe-blocked by Palace Hotel Holland Noordwijk aan zee, despite of the fact – as I said – that I paid for my stay in advance. The helpdesk suggested to contact them. So I did, and nobody replied to me for three days. Then I sent a second email. The extremely irritated and threatening tone of my mail worked: this time I got an answer, with some generic excuses but also pretending that they had already answered to me (false, since I did not find anything even in the spam mail), and that they had talked to their Mastercard helpdesk which had found no blocks in my credits card, and therefore they could not unblock anything. Then there was a very strange request: “Is there a possibility to get your contact details so we can contact  you by phone.! This would make the communications a lot easier.” I called again my Mastercard helpdesk, and they confirmed that Palace Hotel had blocked those amounts: more, they told me that they blocked each amount for 21 days (which never occurred to me before with an hotel, especially after having paid in advance!). I wrote again to the hotel, and the same lady replied very rapidly (interesting how now email communications worked smoothly now) starting with a sentence that tells everything about the sovereign confusion that rules in that hotel: “Unfortunately you do not wish to provide me with your contact  details, therefore I can not contact you personally to explain the  situation to you”, and insisted repeating the same things written before. ,I guess I don’t need to continue.',\n",

At about 400 mtrs. from the B&B there is a bus stop where the bus from and to Schiphol Airport stops. The B&B has 12 rooms, different in size. You enter the B&B through a small door and you immediately have to climb 2 narrow staircases to reach the first floor where you will find the reception. As there is no elevator the B&B is not appropriate for families with very young children or those with a physical handicap. Staff  is willing to take care of your luggage. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. ,We visited Malts for 3 nights in Februar 2013. We asked for a quiet room which implies that we got a very small one on the second floor. The room is very basic, but has two very good beds with excellent mattresses. It is not possible put them together. There is neither a fridge nor an air-conditioner (the latter is not allowed in such old buildings) . There are a small TV with a lot of channels (probably digital), a table and 2 chairs. There are also a closet and a small bathroom.  The bathroom has a toilet, a washstand and a narrow shower cubicle. The  shower cubicle has no non-skidpads on the floor neither a handrail at the wall, but the owner told me this will be fixed soon. The shower itself is excellent. Towels are changed every 2 days, sheets every 3 days. There are bath/shower gel and shampoo, no piece of soap. Room and bathroom are very clean.

       " ('The idea of this hotel is a \"long term stay\" hotel therefor every room is kitted out with a kitchenette, comprising : small ceramic hob, fridge, small dishwasher, microwave oven and a nespresso machine. Every room has a seating area, a desk with two chairs a large bed flat screen tv and an ample shower room with modern fixtures and fittings. Pots and pans and all the basics are in the kitchen area so for a person who needs a place to stay for more than a week this is ideal. The setting is very nice the colours of the hotel are designed according to the Zen principles and are very tranquil and nice. I needed to be in Amsterdam for two consecutive weekends so i pre booked this hotel and was pleasantly surprised apart from a few teething problems......... The first weekend i had a room with a nespresso machine which didnt work and eventhough i was told they would change it and i would get another one... they didnt..... Upon complaining at check out time the lovely girl just looked at me and said \"i\\'m sorry\". The breakfast area is very very crowded and eventhough the buffet area is nicely decked out it is not easy to move around with your plate and coffee. The food is oke and quite varied but it takes a long time for empty dishes to be replenished and tables to be cleared of dirty dishes. I think they are understaffed. The reception staff is very nice and kind but things do not always get done when asked. The second weekend i was there i was given a similar room but on another floor. Upon entering the room, the microwave gave a beeping sound. I told the reception staff who said they would get it fixed. When i returned after an few hours this was still not done and i had to ask again after which the problem was solved. As expected in an upmarket hotel there is a nespresso machine and water cooker available. Upon arrival there are 2 nespresso capsules and 3 tea bags, 3 condensed milk cups en 3 sugar  and 2 sugar substitute sticks. I made myself a nice coffee (this time the machine worked) in the afternoon when i arrived and one in the morning of the first day before going down to breakfast. Normally housekeeping replenishes the coffee every day (standard in every upmarket hotel). After having another nice sleep i wanted to make myself another coffee the next morning but there were no capsules the housekeeping did not replenish anything. When i asked the reception staff about this they told me that this was hotel policy and that only two capsules are given at the start of your stay..... whether that is 1 night or 10 nights the rest of your stay you have to buy your own capsules at the shopping centre adjacent to the hotel. For the price i paid for the room (a good 150€ a night ) this is an absolute disgrace and i believe they need to change their policy on this. Breakfast was too crowded and again you could hardly juggle your plate amongst the guests and even though there is plenty of seating areas...... everywhere i looked where dirty cups saucers, tables and was it hard to find a clean place to sit. Check out time is 12.00 which is standard and fine as far as i am concerned. It is in that light that i had scheduled a business meeting at 10.30...... so i had tidied up my room ready for my meeting. As i came back to my room from the breakfast area at 10 (having left my belongings in the room) i found the housekeeper turning out my room completely for the next guest. I told her that i did not check out yet and she told me that she had her instructions and i had to leave. Upon complaining at the reception desk the duty manager arranged for my room to be cleaned quickly so that i could hold my meeting anyway. I asked the duty manager whether i could use any of the business rooms or another room for that matter instead but he was quite rigid about it and said that i just had to wait for my room to be finished which it would be in time . Needless to say i lost precious time couldn\\'t prepare properly because i could not enter the room in time and my business partner was not amused.,The hotel is adjacent to a shopping centre which is an added bonus for the ladies, i will probably go back because it is new and convenient with a parking underneath the building (which by the way is not free of charge) and i did like the setting very much and the cleanliness, however when i leave home i will be sure to take a strip of my favourite nespresso capsules with me because i do not function very well with out that first coffee in the morning !!!',\n",
