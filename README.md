The tripadvisor repository is part of the research 'Quality review classification for the hospitality industry'

To run the GAN-BERT model the code has to be run in the following order:

1. Run the tripadvisor scraper in the ta_scraper file
2. Import the scraped csv file in the ta_clean file
3. Import the cleaned dataset in the ganbert_without_recent_review_git file

Finshed!
